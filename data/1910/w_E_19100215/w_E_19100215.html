During the past year it has published a series of articles from the pen of the Editor of THE WATCH TOWER, entitled, &quot;The Divine Program.&quot; This series concludes with the January issue, but will be followed by another series entitled &quot;God's Chosen People.&quot;  Special clubbing rates have been made by which THE WATCH TOWER, the PEOPLES PULPIT and the OVERLAND MONTHLY will be supplied in combination for $1.90 in the United States.  Extra postage outside the United States would make the price $3.00.  Those who have already paid for one or more of these, may still have the advantage of the clubbing rate by remitting to us the difference.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">            </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">FOREIGN BRANCHES--1909</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THE brethren in charge of the foreign branches made their reports in due season, but we were unavoidably prevented from printing them until now.  We are sure that they will be of deep interest to all WATCH TOWER readers.  We have nothing in a concrete form to present respecting developments in Africa and India.  However, matters in those lands are progressing as satisfactorily as could be expected.  Of course, opposition is encountered everywhere, but not from the worldly.  As it was the Scribes and Pharisees who opposed the Gospel message eighteen centuries ago, so similar classes oppose the Gospel of the Kingdom now. As then the rulers were &quot;grieved that he taught the people,&quot; so it is now.  There seems to be little objection to the various forms of error, Christian Science, Higher Criticism, Evolution, etc., but the moment the Truth is presented anger and opposition are aroused.  This seems to prove our theory that the Adversary himself is exciting and driving our deluded opponents to envy, malice, hatred, strife, slander, evil-speaking and insinuations, which are his methods.  Would that all of God's consecrated people could realize this!  What a change it would speedily effect--even those blinded by error would then be saved from being used as Satan's tools!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The reading of the reports following will certainly prove a great encouragement to all who love the Lord and who delight to note the prosperity of the Truth.  Of course, to those that walk no longer with us the effect will be the reverse.  Things once despised they now love; things which they once loved they now despise.  The reports show that the sifting work is in progress all over the harvest field.  This is just what we should expect. While our hearts ache for the dear friends who have left us, the fact that they so speedily lose not only the Truth, but its spirit of love, reconciles us the more quickly to the situation and shows us that their condition of heart, which we did not suspect, but of which the Lord well knew, must have been behind their rejection by him and the taking from them the light of Present Truth.  The evidences from every quarter are that many more are coming into the Truth than are leaving it.  And apparently those now coming in have been under the Lord's supervising care and in another department of the School of Christ for some time.  Now as their eyes are open to the harvest message they feed upon it rapaciously.  So successfully do they assimilate the Truth that sometimes a six-months' beginner may be able to correct even a leader who has been in the Truth for ten or twenty years, but who has neglected reading.  We cannot too strongly urge the fact that our vessels are leaky and require frequent spirit renewings.  We are glad to note from letters received that the number of those reading twelve pages of the &quot;Dawn-Studies&quot; each day is increasing.  We believe this to be one of the very best methods of Bible study-- putting on the whole armor of God, fortifying heart and head.  We learned with pleasure that during our absence, on New Year's Day, nearly all the members of the Bethel family resolved to follow this method and so to accomplish the reading of the entire six volumes of &quot;Scriptural Studies&quot; during the year 1910.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">           </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF BRITISH BRANCH</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I have pleasure in sending once again the British yearly report of books sold and work accomplished in this part of the Harvest Field.  The year has not been specially notable in any of the various features of the harvesting, but you will see that the general activities have been kept up and the results betoken increase of interest.  You will know that trade in these countries has not been very brisk, and you would partially expect, if not a decrease in the sale of STUDIES, not any notable increase.  We have indeed to report a slight decrease in the circulation of the cloth-bound Vol. I, but there has been a considerable increase in the output of the cheaper issue.  Our total, as shown on sheet No. 1, is 46,926 STUDIES and DAWNS and other books, amounting in all to 61,225 books and booklets.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Tract work has gone on well.  If our brethren find it hard to sell books they find it easy to give out tracts.  These have been circulated to the extent of 2,369,000, at the rate of nearly 50,000 per week.  The newer form--the PEOPLES PULPIT--is very popular both with the brethren and with those who look for our tracts; and the No. 3, &quot;Where Are the Dead?&quot; has brought forth many inquiries.  People will read a paper when they will not read a tract.  Then the small inset picture of yourself on the first page has done good by letting people see we are not associated with &quot;Dowieism,&quot; which many have believed was the case.  The inquiries and the results show that there are many waiting to hear some satisfying news of the love of God; and regularly we are getting evidences of the blessing which the STUDIES are bringing to the people.  It has been a surprise to me that there has not been a large increase in the sales of these books, for surely in this country the Lord must have many who fear him.  I believe there is a large number of the class who have been associated with religious work, an intelligent middle-class, who have as yet hardly been touched with the</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4563 : page 68::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">books, and I cannot but think many of these will come to the Lord through the Harvest work.  There seems no chance of newspaper work here in the meantime, but surely the heavy tract work must to some extent correspond with the newspaper work of the States.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I regret that there is as yet no further information to send you about a central meeting hall for London. No doubt we could have a choice of several places if we were in for buying property; but we are waiting upon the Lord, as I know you are.  The British friends look forward with eagerness to your return, desiring it as soon as it can be arranged.  The year has brought us trials, sorrows, disappointments, but the joy of Harvest is surely ours, and the many evidences of the Father's favor have been especially sweet.  The work goes on, and the prospects are good at present.  We want to use all our opportunities for witnessing to the Truth and to the Kingdom before the end comes.  In humbleness of mind we pray the Lord to keep us and to keep all his own, and we pray especially for you, dear brother, that in the multitude of your labors you may be kept.  With much love from the household and from all the brethren, I am</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">        </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">REPORT OF AUSTRALASIAN BRANCH</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are pleased to send along herewith the usual Annual Statement; we could have hoped to have a better account to render, but under the circumstances we are thankful that it is what it is through the faithful efforts of the colporteurs and zealous and earnest friends.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">You will notice that we wind up the year as has always been the case since the Branch started, with an increased debt to Brooklyn.  This increase shows a little more than usual on account of including the amount of fares of Brother and Sister Henninges back to Buffalo.  We should have liked to see Australasia somewhat more, if not entirely, self-supporting, and possibly many of the friends have not realized their privilege of co-operation in this way.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There remains little of Australasia that has not been colporteured, only a few isolated places; but we trust that a second going over the territory will prove even better in results as to the finding of &quot;wheat,&quot; and just as easy for the Colporteurs to make their way.  We are glad that the Lord has put it in the hearts of our Brother and Sister Richardson to stay in these parts notwithstanding that it has meant so much of self-sacrifice for them to do so; and we hope that others may come forward in this the eleventh hour to enter the joys of the Harvest work.  We have now five other laborers in this privileged service, Brother and Sister Thompson having left</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4564 : page 68::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">for home by way of Ceylon, India and England.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Volunteer work shows a bit less output than previously; but the outlook for the ensuing year is better, and able and willing ones are now getting systematically to work.  One dear elderly Brother comes in regularly for his weekly supply, his face always beaming with joy at the privileges which he has of being able to put out 1,000 to 1,200 PEOPLES PULPITS per week.  Throughout Australasia the work goes forward and new interest continually comes to light of some who are rejoicing in the very truths from which others have turned aside.  It is as though those who have become upset over the Vow and become blinded as regards the Covenants and the Church's high calling have made room for others to &quot;take their crowns.&quot;  The great lesson appears to be &quot;Take heed&quot;--&quot;Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, as was anticipated, Bro. H. carried the bulk of the Melbourne class with him.  He had such a hold upon them that there was small opportunity for assisting them to the truth on the points at issue.  He also did what he could to prevent their reading the TOWERS, so that some TOWERS received from America were simply readdressed to this office unopened (only two or three). Some whom I had not seen for two years and had left at that time in good fellowship--nothing having passed between us in the meantime--wanted to pass us on the street as though we were poison.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We have tried to take advantage of any opportunity that any would give us of helping them, and the Lord has been pleased to bless our efforts in this way so that some have been regained.  When we started here there were about twelve with us; now we have usually about twenty-five at our Sunday evening meeting--but probably not more than twenty are thoroughly established in the Truth. Bro. H., I think, still holds about eighty or so, but many of them are not readers to any extent and have been drawn to his meetings rather by his &quot;eloquence&quot; than by the Truth.  Some of them do not even acknowledge the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;parousia,&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and one who happened to come in yesterday had still the thought that man has an immortal soul.  I do not think that Bro. H. is making any progress, as I have not heard of any that he has gained, while we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">can</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> count a few, say about ten, around Melbourne, besides more in other parts.  Though our numbers remain low, it is not because there have not been additions, but on account of so many going out of the city, either to go into the Colporteur work or for private reasons.  All the same, we are not discouraged and do not want to accomplish more than the Lord is willing for us to do; only we do not wish to leave a stone unturned to the end that we may gather every grain of &quot;wheat&quot; in the vicinity.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are contemplating more Pilgrim work, but of course the distances are great and the little companies are far between.  Brother Nicholson has just returned from a trip to South Australia, where he enjoyed the privilege of blessed meetings with the friends in Adelaide and other points.  Brother Nelson is making preparations for a trip to Tasmania and New Zealand, coming around by New South Wales.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We would think it good for you to draw the attention of the Australian friends to this part of the work, especially if you think one or the other of us should be out most of the time.  The friends here have not responded to the invitation in the May TOWER regarding Pilgrim trips, thinking, we suppose, that the matter referred to America only.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">As we expected at the beginning of the past year we have, during the same, seen greater victories for the Truth than in any other twelve-months period up to the present, and the prospects just now are more encouraging than ever, a fact that seems to indicate that this is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">the</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Lord's time</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> to gather the last of his jewels, and, by his own methods, to finish their preparation for the coming &quot;Glory, Honor and Immortality.&quot;  We have also had the most abundant proofs that even the multitude begin to listen with joy to the &quot;good tidings&quot; and wish to hear of God's </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">true</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> character and plan.  The doors of </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">opportunity</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are open wider than at any time before and inspire us to pray the Lord of the Harvest to send more able and willing laborers to this end of the large field.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In spite of the bad economic circumstances which the Swedish people, and many of the Truth friends also, have been in for the last four months, because of the great conflicts here between employees and employers, we are able to report a considerable increase in the circulation of DAWN-STUDIES as well as in other directions.  We have sold over 2,000 more books and nearly 5,000 more booklets, TABERNACLE SHADOWS, etc., than last year.  About ten regular Colporteurs have been at work during the year; they are all very thankful to the Lord for the privilege of spreading his message abroad.  Of late six or seven new ones have come into the work--one of these is a dear Brother in Finland who, no doubt, is a chosen instrument in the Lord's hand to serve his people in that country.  This Brother came in contact with the Truth only five months ago, but his love for the Lord and his zeal for Present Truth are very great.  A few days ago he visited Orebro in order to symbolize his consecration and to confer with us about the work and prospect for the Truth in his native country.  Another Brother also in that land seems now to intend to sell his farm and go out as a Colporteur there.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The number of subscribers to the Swedish WATCH TOWER has increased only by a little more than 200, but we have received many proofs, by letters, etc., that it is much appreciated and a great help to its readers in general. A good many new subscribers for next year are expected.  We have also published a new edition of 10,000 copies of &quot;About Hell,&quot; an edition of 9,000 copies of &quot;About Spiritism,&quot; an edition of 5,000 copies of a new hymn book containing 166 very good hymns for use at our meetings, and besides this eight different tracts, or parts of the Swedish PEOPLES PULPIT--about two millions altogether.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our efforts to have the tracts distributed with the newspapers as supplements have not led to any result, but still we have sent out nearly twice as much &quot;Volunteer&quot; matter as in the preceding year, and the friends in general seem more and more to appreciate the opportunities of service offered to them through the Society's generous arrangements in this matter.  As an example I will mention how a Brother living in a little place at a distance from here has of late begun to systematically send out the tracts to all small villages and parts of the country where the Colporteurs and usual tract distributers have not been.  He puts a four-fold tract into one of our envelopes, stamps it at his own expense, and sends it out according to the directory.  Several orders for the first volume have already arrived at the office from remote places as a result of this Brother's work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Pilgrim work has been greatly extended, as the following report will show.  Five Swedish Brethren have taken part in this service during the year, and the Lord has richly blessed their efforts to edify the friends, and also the many meetings held for the public in nearly all parts of the country.  One general convention has been held in Orebro, when the Truth friends in attendance, numbering about 350, had the privilege of partaking of the spiritual feast the Lord spread before us by you as his mouthpiece.  We also held about ten local two-days' conventions at different places, all of which were blessed of the Lord to the encouraging of his people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The amount of the donations to the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tract Fund</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is not quite as high as last year's total, but still the sum is very good in view of the poverty of most of the friends in Sweden.  And then we must consider that a large part of their savings has been used to rent halls for meeting, the advertising of public meetings, etc., which is </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">not</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> included in the report.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hearty expressions of love and thankfulness for the faithful service you, Brother Russell, as the Lord's special servant at the present time, have rendered to the blessing and help of his people even in these lands, have been made in numerous letters received here from different parts.  It is but proper for me to convey all this love and thankfulness to you.  Please find enclosed a further list of two hundred and two Swedish Brethren and Sisters who have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">voluntarily</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> taken the &quot;Vow&quot; and ask us to send you notice of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4565 : page 69::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   We start the New Year with brighter prospects before us than ever, and we pledge our faithful services to the Lord and to the Society and pray that we, by his grace, may remain steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, even unto death.</font><br />

I am sorry to say that most of the Thun and Berne classes prefer to go their own way.

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">With gratitude toward God and our dear Redeemer we look back upon another year of service in his cause. We feel that a good deal has been accomplished, though we could wish the results were greater.  But we comfort ourselves with the Apostle's exhortation, &quot;Inasmuch as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.&quot;  We certainly feel drawn closer to him for having been engaged in his service, and we know of a good many others who have been richly blessed.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The German WATCH TOWER list now exceeds 3,000 subscribers, and certainly quite a number more readers. We are encouraged by this increase of interest.  Many of the dear friends have patiently co-labored variously in the &quot;preaching&quot; of the glorious Gospel of Christ and the Kingdom.  In the distribution of tracts mentioned below they have had a large share, likewise in getting their friends and neighbors to read the STUDIES and booklets.  Thus, with the few Colporteurs, who are able to remain in the field, we can rejoice in noting the totals of</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The new year promises to be still more favorable.  We anticipate that with PEOPLES PULPIT in German we shall hear of much new interest.  The &quot;people&quot; are being waked up!  We are sure that these plain, simple truths concerning the good tidings and the Kingdom will convince many.  Of course, we find that our opponents are angered.  Some of them, we know, must admit that our presentations are reasonable and Scriptural, but they fear to &quot;let the people know.&quot;  Others are proclaiming the setting up of the Kingdom in 1915 without giving the source of their information or the proofs.  However, we think it is a good sign that the Truth is making some impressions.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a word about the siftings of this year.  Some, indeed, have gone out from amongst us here in Germany, too, and they are using the very same arguments as are in English--they are busy translating.  So we see that the Adversary seems to have great liberties just now.  Indeed, we see signs of still greater activities on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> part. But we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the Lord is on </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">our</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> part, and that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Truth</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will fully sanctify (separate to himself) those who appreciate the &quot;mystery&quot; of the Kingdom, of the Church, and who are giving all diligence in Faith and Patience and Love.  The Vow assists us in watching and praying.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I am glad to say that quite a number of the German friends have reported that they took the Vow, and to me</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4565 : page 71::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">it is a source of strength, not only to be amongst those who have thus formed a special prayer circle, but to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">know</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that on such a basis of faith and prayer we </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">cannot</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> be deceived so far as the teaching of the Word is concerned.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">The blessing of the Lord which maketh rich continues to flow upon us in Jamaica.  The year which has just closed has brought us more of his favors than previous ones, as we should have expected; but these have come to us in ways a little different from those of any other year when viewed as a whole.  It has been peculiarly a year of difficulties and drawbacks and disappointments and hardness, changing the course of many of our best endeavors.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Colporteurs have come in for the largest share of these trials, which have tested their faith and patience to the limit.  Although that part of the service began under very auspicious circumstances, it was not long before the Lord of the Harvest began to show them how great things they must suffer for his name.  Those who engaged as Regulars were only two less than last year, but some of these had to leave the field altogether and were nigh unto death because of their zeal for the work; others, through unavoidable causes, could not return as they expected; and only a few, perhaps not more than a half dozen, were able to continue for any considerable length of time.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">One other thing which contributed much to the difficulty was the strenuous opposition from the shepherds &quot;out of the way.&quot;  As careful as some were to avoid them, they often returned to the field with scores of volumes for delivery and found it impossible to deliver them because some shepherd had learned of it and poisoned the minds of all who had given orders.  The work is done in the country parts, where one person's business is everybody's business.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Pilgrim Service surpassed all others in the amount of work done, not because we tried to make it so, but because the circumstances would not have it otherwise. And we have found in our little territory that when one or two branches of the service expand unusually, there is a corresponding contraction in some of the others, which apparently cannot be avoided.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">If this is the Lord's method, we accept it as ours and will continue to thank him for the least privilege of serving him and his dear people.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are pleased at the great number of those whom outside circumstances, as well as the life of the Truth people, have made ready to investigate &quot;this way.&quot;  Some have received a genuine and lasting impression; but alas! others have gone out from us because they ceased to be of us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Costa Rica and Barbados have received much spiritual profit through the ministrations of the two Pilgrim Brethren sent to them; and we hope that we shall soon be able to find servants among them, qualified to dispense the Truth to the edification of those classes and relieve those Pilgrims for service elsewhere.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The spiritual condition of the Brethren everywhere is good, even while the whip of small cords in the hand of the Chief Reaper is doing its work of manifesting the true and the false.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The &quot;Covenants&quot; and the &quot;Vow&quot; have not been stumbling-blocks to us because we are not sufficiently educated for that, but the Lord is using other means to test our loyalty to him.  He has shown us some favors recently, which make us confident that the coming year will bring us greater opportunities than ever for expanding all branches of the work, and rendering more efficient service.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We remember you daily in our prayers, and thank you for your assurances in word and deed that you have a genuine interest in our welfare.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">         </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">VOLUNTEER WORK EXTRAORDINARY</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   The four Christian Mass-Meetings recently held in the Brooklyn Academy of Music for the consideration of what the leading Christian denominations would be obliged to surrender in favor of Church Federation, required widespread advertising.  Newspapers and billboards and window-cards were extensively used; but the Volunteer work was specially effective.  It was the most systematic and successful of which we have knowledge. We must describe it for the encouragement of Volunteers everywhere:</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Think of it--more than 300,000 copies of PEOPLES PULPIT were distributed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">carefully</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> in one week, and the second week brought the total up to 530,000!  These contained two sermons each, besides the back-page advertisement of the Mass-Meetings.  Thus more than a million sermons were put into the hands of intelligent people, many of whom do not usually attend Church services. And if each paper reached five persons (which is the usual newspaper claim), then five million sermons were delivered in two weeks by the Brooklyn and vicinity Tabernacle Congregation.  Thank God for such privileges!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) The city was districted and each of the congregations which could do so served its own district.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) Managers of factories were approached in a pleasant and dignified manner by specially selected Sisters. They were presented with P.P. and asked if the employees might be served at time of dismission, and how many, at what hour, and the number of exits.  Later, these were served by Volunteers supplied with P.P. in plenty.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) The managers of large department stores were similarly approached re employees.  These gladly attended to the distribution themselves, with thanks!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) Large restaurants and hotels also accepted supplies and gave them to their patrons.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) Of course, the house-to-house distribution was the great work, and it included the serving of the large office buildings.  This was a delicate matter, as ordinary circularizing is not allowed.  But our P.P. are not circulars. Some of the brightest of the Sisters were assigned this work, and they did it well.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) It is needless to say that the Colporteurs of Brooklyn and vicinity were amongst the most active of the Volunteers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(7) What has been done can be done again--not only here, but in every city and village.  Surely the Volunteers get the very cream of the blessing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(8) How many can afford to miss so glorious an opportunity for serving the Lord, the Truth and the Brethren?</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(9) Elect your Volunteer Captains and Lieutenants at once and advise us </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">how many</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> copies of this year's Volunteer papers (PEOPLES PULPIT) you can and will use-- wasting none.  Give full shipping directions.  We supply PEOPLES PULPIT free of charge--prepaying freight.  Respond quickly that we may know how many millions to print.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       --`MATTHEW 6:19-34`.--FEBRUARY 13.--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text:--&quot;Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">his righteousness and all these things shall be added</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">unto you.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THE Great Teacher taught no extravagance. He was energetic in the Father's business and taught his followers to be &quot;not slothful in business, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.&quot;  Nevertheless his teaching in this lesson is that our energies are not to take the selfish form of laying up earthly treasures: We are to lay up heavenly treasures instead.  Notwithstanding the reference to</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4567 : page 72::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">moth and rust and thieves despoiling earthly treasures, we understand his teaching rather on a higher plane, though the principle is a broad one.  All will admit that it would be folly to lay up clothing or food far in advance of need, except under very peculiar circumstances. But gold might be treasured, or money in the bank, or bonds, or stocks, or farm added to farm, and house to house, and the same principle would be involved.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Although no moth could touch the bank account, nor rust injure the gold, and no thieves could steal the title to the property, the principle is the same.  Treasures of every kind may lose their value--do lose their value to us, when we die, if not before.  Death, corruption, touches everything earthly under present conditions, no matter how careful or thoughtful the provision.  &quot;Naked came we into the world, and naked must we leave it.&quot; (`Job. 1:21`.) Intelligent people are generally agreed that God has provided a future life beyond the tomb, attainable in the resurrection morning.  And the Scriptures teach that the degree of our blessing then will stand related to our use of the present life.  It is this point that the Great Teacher emphasized in the study of today.  All intelligent minds assent to the reasonableness of this.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us not take the extreme view entertained by some; let us not suppose that the Master taught that people might not make reasonable provision for their own comfort, and that they might not be dependent upon charity in old age.  Let us not suppose that he meant that parents should be neglectful of their duties toward dependent members of their family.  The Bible distinctly teaches that &quot;he who provides not for his own is worse than an unbeliever.&quot;  The proper thought, then is that it is right to economize and, as St. Paul expresses it, &quot;to lay by in store&quot; for our own future needs or that we may have to lend to others, in need.  God's people are to be frugal, to avoid debts, to be &quot;forehanded,&quot; and with some reserve of capital.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But earthly things are not to be the treasures of their souls, but merely their servants, conveniences--always ready for use, for every emergency, freely, whole-heartedly. He who follows this course will rarely have large earthly wealth.  Only by making wealth a treasure and setting upon it inordinate desire can one become miserly or very rich.  Setting the affections on things above would signify so loose a handling of worldly riches as would hinder the accumulation or preservation of great wealth.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Master's word is, that whoever sets his affections upon earthly treasures will become sordid, selfish, earthly; while he who sets his affections upon the things above will become correspondingly heavenly, spiritual, blessed, generous.  We have two eyes and if they be not properly adjusted with relationship to each other our vision of things will be distorted.  Hence we seek to correct such a difficulty, that we may get the true view of matters.  So it is with the eye of our understanding.  It has both a present and a future outlook, an earthly and a heavenly view.  It is important that we get these rightly adjusted, so that we may see matters in their true light--see the great value of the future life in comparison with the present one, and correspondingly be guided to the setting of</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4567 : page 73::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">our heart affections there, and in general balancing all the interests of life wisely.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As in the natural body the eyes may become darkened or blinded, so it is with our eyes of understanding.  And if this blindness come upon us after we have once seen and enjoyed the Divine promise, our case would be all the more pitiable.  How great that darkness would be!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Still another lesson there is for us along the same line.  The serving of mammon would bless us in the present life, but be injurious to our future interests.  But the service of God would prepare us for future influence. And although obedience to God may cost us the loss of the pleasures of sin and the loss of some legitimate worldly blessing in the present time, nevertheless there is a blessing even now to those who are faithful servants of God and righteousness.  And additionally there is the glorious prospect of the future.  It is necessary, however, for us to choose between the two masters.  We cannot serve both.  We cannot get the rewards of both.  As Joshua did, so let us determine, &quot;As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Master urges us to commit all of our interests to God and to wholly resolve to be obedient to him, to the extent of our ability, and then to realize the Divine care which is over all creation to be specially over us, because of having come into special relationship to him, in accordance with his promises.  Such need have no </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">anxiety</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> with respect to their earthly affairs, but may trust all their interests to their Heavenly Father.  Our eternal life is worth more than the food and raiment of the present life. If wise we will seek the future life at any cost, at any sacrifice of the present one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">As for the ability of our Heavenly Father to care for our interests, we should consider the manifestations in nature of his power and wisdom and grace, in his provision for the fowl of the air and for the lily of the field. We should realize that he has equal power to provide for our best interests; thus faith should firmly trust him, come what may.  Suppose we were of small stature, and inclined to </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">worry</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> over the matter of increasing our height?  Then let us realize our own littleness and look rather to the Lord for the things respecting the present as well as the future life.  Let us be diligent in his service, leaving all of our present experiences as well as our future rewards to his wisdom, love and power.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Should we suppose that God, who cares for the lilies and the birds, would not much more care for us after we had become his children through faith in Christ and through the consecration of our lives?  Let us then cast off all anxious care respecting food and raiment and all matters pertaining to these which the world in general are worried about.  To be without worry would not mean to be without </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">proper concern</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> and due diligence to find work and to do it.  But our Father knows better than we the things that we really need, and faith is not merely to trust him, but to accept what he gives as being for our best interests.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our chief concern as followers of Christ is to seek to attain a share in God's Kingdom with our dear Redeemer --a share in the Millennial Kingdom as the Bride of Christ, who shall sit with him in his glorious Throne for the blessing and uplifting of the world of mankind. We have our Master's assurance for it that whoever pursues this course will do wisely and that God will look out for his earthly interests, for his highest welfare. So doing our lives will be crowned with peace and joy and rest in the Lord, which in his Word he has promised those who trust him.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">               </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">THE GOLDEN RULE</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">       --`MATTHEW 7:1-12`.--FEBRUARY 20.--</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Golden Text:--&quot;Therefore, all things whatsoever ye</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">for this is the Law and the Prophets.&quot;</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;NEVER man spake like this man.&quot;  Perhaps the nearest teaching to this Golden Rule was the maxim attributed to Confucius, &quot;Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you.&quot;  This latter is a grand teaching, but it is far inferior to the former, which is sublime.  Christians are not to be negative, but positive.  They are not merely to follow the standards of others, but to set standards; they are to raise up the Lord's standard before the people.  It is not for the followers of Jesus to say, &quot;We will endeavor to keep within the bonds of human law,&quot; but rather, &quot;We will live according to the Divine Law, so far as possible. We will esteem that human law represents the standard of the majority of fallen men and not the Divine standard.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Savior tells us that we will be tested along the line of our love for God and for our neighbor.  God through the merit of Christ's sacrifice has provided forgiveness for our past sins, and now purposes that as his children we shall be taught the lesson of mercy, kindness, forgiveness toward others.  Hence he tells us that only in proportion as we exercise benevolence towards others need we expect his benevolence in respect to our weaknesses and shortcomings.  The principle of justice is involved in this.  Whoever is kind and forgiving towards others demonstrates the possession of love in a ruling, dominating degree.  And &quot;Love is the fulfilling of the Law.&quot;  Hence these may be treated as though they were perfect, because their conduct towards others gives evidence that their hearts are right--ruled by love; and that the imperfections which cause their trespasses are merely weaknesses of the flesh, which may be forgiven, because not of the heart.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">From this viewpoint how should Christians judge one another as respects motive, intention, etc.?  Surely most leniently!  How should they measure one another's endeavors? Surely most generously!  How should they look upon the blemish in a brother?  Would not their sympathy cause his defects to seem the smaller in their estimation?  And would not their own imperfections show the more largely to themselves?  Surely such would be more concerned in removing the beam from their own eyes than in assisting the brother to free himself of the mote or lesser blemish troubling him.  Hence we may suppose that the continual fault-finder, who sees great blemishes in others and who sees none in himself, is blind to his own defects or hypocritical.  This is the Master's word.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We are, nevertheless, to discriminate.  Not all are brethren in Christ, begotten of the holy Spirit.  Of the remainder some are more, and some less, brutish.  Hence in our dealings with various classes of people (`v. 6`), we should avoid presenting the holiest and most precious things of our religion to those who are in no condition to appreciate or understand them.  They would doubtless</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4568 : page 74::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">resent them and do us injury.  On the contrary, we are to be wise as serpents in the presentation of the Truth and harmless as doves.  We are to make known the riches of God's grace to those who have the hearing ear.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">All the consecrated followers of Jesus are to be free to come in his name to the Throne of grace to make request for the things which they need--the things promised in the Word of God to the faithful.  We are to seek for them and we shall find them.  Knocking, we shall have Divine blessings unlocked before us.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Consider how this principle prevails, even amongst fallen humanity.  Any father asked for a fish, would he give instead a serpent?  If asked for bread, would he give a stone?  Surely not!  And if so, what shall we say in respect to our Heavenly Father?  Would he not be all the more willing to give to his children who ask him? He has indeed given us many blessings without the asking, but some of the chiefest of his favors he withholds from us until we make requests--because thus he would draw us nearer to himself and prepare us the more for the blessings he is willing to bestow.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Elsewhere the Master tells us that the good thing which the Father is specially pleased to bestow is his holy Spirit.  This is the all-important thing, for only as we become possessors thereof, only as we attain to the mind, the disposition of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, shall we be fit for a place in the glorious Millennial Kingdom to which we have been invited.  His holy Spirit is manifested in us by meekness, gentleness, patience, long suffering, brotherly kindness--love.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Golden Text of our study is (`v. 12`), &quot;All things, therefore, whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them; for this is the Law and the prophets.&quot;  The whole demand of the Law of God is briefly summed up in this Golden Rule.  Yet the Christian has an additional requirement--the Lord's &quot;New Commandment.&quot;  To attain joint-heirship with the Redeemer in his Kingdom we must &quot;love one another&quot; as our Redeemer loved us--to the degree of self-sacrifice, even unto death.  &quot;We ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren.&quot;--`I John 3:16`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We would be glad, indeed, if all of our readers would resolve to follow the Golden Rule in all of life's affairs; but we could not hope to have them do so, because we cannot hope that they are all fully consecrated to God. Nothing short of full devotion to the Lord and instructions in the School of Christ will enable a man or a woman to live consistently along the lines of this Golden Rule. Only by the assisting grace of the Great Teacher can this rule obtain, even in the consecrated heart.  We urge, therefore, that the consecrated shall follow this rule, and the &quot;New Commandment,&quot; and that others should make consecration.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">THE ADVANCE of the world in civilization, coupled with a general lowering of Christian standards in neglect of the Bible, has drawn the civilized world and the nominal Church very close together.  Never more necessary than now are the Master's words of this Bible Study, &quot;Enter ye in by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be that enter thereby; for narrow is the gate and straitened the way that leads unto life and few there be that find it.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The teaching of the dark ages handed down to us was that the many walking on the broad road are being swept by millions into eternal torture.  The general revulsion from this interpretation of the Bible has shaken confidence in the Bible itself and turned many completely away from it to a mild form of Universalism--to the hope that nearly everybody at death goes immediately to glory, regardless of whether he walks in the narrow way of discipleship or in the broad, easy way of worldliness.  In every sense of the word the effect of this misinterpretation has been injurious.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Now we perceive that the Master said not that the broad, easy road leads to eternal torture, but to destruction --death.  Now we see that father Adam by disobedience was cut off from fellowship with his Creator under death sentence and that his children were all born in a sinful and alienated condition and that their perverted appetites and the influences bearing upon them constitute a broad road of self-gratification down which they are speeding to the tomb.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Our Lord came as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">world's</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Redeemer, but before dealing with the race as a whole he selects the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Church</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> class--disciples.  The love and loyalty of these is tested by their call to walk contrary to the general tendencies of the world--upward along the narrow way, at the end of which they are promised eternal life--glory, honor, and immortality and association with the Redeemer in his great work of the Millennial Kingdom.  Then he will deal with humanity now going down on the broad road to death--recovering them and giving them glorious opportunities secured by his sacrifice.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The present call to discipleship is through the narrow gate of full consecration, even unto death, in the footsteps of the Master, and few there be who find and willingly walk this way.  Thank God that the masses of humanity on the broad road were redeemed and will yet be blessed, though they will miss the great &quot;prize&quot; now offered to the &quot;elect,&quot; who walk the narrow way.  Eventually only the wilfully wicked will be destroyed in the Second Death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Lord's disciples are to beware of false teachers who pretend to be shepherds and wear the cloth, but really they are unlike the Great Shepherd.  They are self-seekers, ravenous, wolfish.  They do not lay down their lives for the sheep, but feed upon the sheep.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It is forbidden us to judge the heart.  &quot;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&quot; (`Matt. 7:1`.)  The Master here illustrates that we shall judge those professing to be his disciples by the general fruits of their lives.  Are they sharp, thorny, injurious, poisonous, in their influence upon others, or are they helpful, strengthening, uplifting? As a tree may be known and graded by its fruitage, so also may a man be known--and especially such as profess discipleship, such as profess to be followers of Christ and taught of him.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Nor will it do to make professions and offer prayers, saying, &quot;Lord, Lord.&quot;  Not all such will enter the Kingdom and become joint-heirs with Christ.  Only such will be acceptable as will do the will of the Father.  Not, however, that any can live up to the height of the Divine</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4568 : page 75::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">standard in every word and act.  But the heart, the will, must be right, sincere, true, pure, loyal to God and to the principles of his Government.  And this being the case every shortcoming will be a cause of regret and the whole life will gradually become changed, &quot;transformed.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When at the close of this age the Heavenly King shall return, before establishing his Millennial Kingdom to deal with the world, he will reckon with his Church that he may first reward the faithful with a share in his Kingdom.  Then, he declares, it will be seen that not a few, but many who prophesied or taught in his name and did many wonderful works, and even cast out devils, will be found unworthy of the Kingdom, because of not having developed characters in harmony with the Father's Law--the Golden Rule.  The King will say to such, I do not recognize you and cannot receive you as my Elect Bride.  Your work on the whole is unacceptable, iniquitous, out of harmony with the principles of my teaching.  Such, instead of entering the glories of the Kingdom, will be obliged to pass through tribulations with the world, losing their share of the great prize of this Gospel Age.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Whoever is now blessed with the hearing ear, whoever now hears the call of discipleship, whoever now accepts the call and becomes by consecration a follower of Christ, has the opportunity of erecting a faith structure which will stand all the storms of life, because built upon the Rock.  Christ is this Rock of Ages.  He is not only the great Redeemer, but to those now called, he is the great Exemplar, in whose footsteps all shall follow who desire to become joint-heirs with him in his Heavenly Kingdom.  Those who essay to become his disciples and who, nevertheless, neglect a careful following of his instructions are building false hopes, building upon a foundation which will not stand the storms and trials of life, which are specially permitted as tests of character upon those favored with the call of this Gospel Age.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Apostle, describing the testing of the Church and the proving of our discipleship, likens the testing to a fire, saying (not of the world, but of the Church), &quot;Every man's work shall be made manifest; for the day</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4569 : page 75::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.  If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.&quot; (`I Cor. 3:13-15`.)  The Apostle here describes the testings of those who build upon the Rock.  Those who build upon the sand will suffer the loss of everything and at the beginning of the Millennium will be no better off than the world in general.</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">            </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">MID-WINTER CONVENTIONS</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">OUR trial of Mid-Winter Conventions has proven only partly satisfactory.  In several instances the cold and storms hindered large audiences, and on two or three occasions delayed our arrival on schedule time.  The lesson is that hereafter we should not tempt Providence, but hold all Southern conventions in the winter and Northern conventions in the summer.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">However, we are not complaining.  On the contrary, no doubt the disappointments served to test our faith in the Lord's oversight of his work, and our submission to his providences.  We are to remember how our Lord refused to leap from the pinnacle of the Temple, because such </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">faith</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> would be tempting Providence.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The friends everywhere got a reward for their labors of love in preparing for the meetings, even when the expected results were not attained--so did the speaker.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Pittsburg Convention was a success in every way.  The forenoon session was devoted to the election of servants for the Church for 1910; the Editor had been re-elected pastor for 1910 on the previous Sunday.  The Testimony Meeting which followed the election was a most interesting one.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The afternoon session for the public was in the Allegheny Opera House, where about 1,000 gave close attention --an excellent audience for the cold and unfavorable weather and the slippery condition of the streets.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the evening Bible House Chapel was crowded beyond its capacity.  Following a discourse we shook hands with the company and took train for Elgin, Ills.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Chicago, we were joined by about 100 in two special cars.  Notwithstanding the cold weather we had refreshing there, as also at Rockford and Milwaukee.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Indianapolis a Three-Day Convention was attended by about 400 from nearby points.  Much as we should have enjoyed staying to its conclusion we could not, but after one day sped on to Columbus, O., and then to Brooklyn.  At both of those places the results were most instructing and seemingly profitable.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Richmond, Va., the storm hindered our arrival in proper season, but did not hinder about 1,300 hearing a public address (by Brother Wright), nor hinder about 300 of the friends hearing us at the evening session.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Knoxville, Tenn., then Atlanta, Ga., then Birmingham, Ala., and Memphis, Tenn., had interesting meetings; the latter two lasted for three days each, being supplied by Pilgrims as announced.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Fort Smith, Ark., there was also a Three-Day Convention--remarkably well attended.  Nowhere did the friends appear more zealous and enthusiastic.  Before 6 o'clock next morning about 65 were at the depot to bid us a final adieu.  They sang for us, &quot;God be with you.&quot; Our next stop was at St. Louis, Mo., where we addressed about 250 of the interested from 9 to 10.30 p.m.  Quite a number accompanied us to the depot.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Sunday at Chicago was a grand one, which we and many will long remember.  We arrived in season to give our testimony at the Testimony Meeting of the forenoon. The afternoon meeting at the great Auditorium was a success.  The dear friends had spared neither time nor money nor labor to make it a success.  About 3,500 were present.  We had excellent attention.  Many prayed and all hoped that the results would be helpful to some and to the honor of our Lord.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">In the evening we had a heart-to-heart talk with the interested for nearly two hours more--on the Covenants, the Ransom, etc.  After it we had a season of handshaking and good wishing for each other's future, as the dear friends, tired, but happy, went to their homes.  The meeting, we learned, cost the friends over $800 and many days of hard labor in circulating PEOPLES PULPIT, ads., window cards, etc.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">At Bloomington, Ills., the meetings were not so large, but they were very good and we trust very helpful to the friends as well as to some of the public.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Dubuque appointment was delayed by the cold and storm; but nevertheless we had an hour for the interested and fully two hours for the public.  The class here is small but very intelligent and earnest.  We hope</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4569 : page 76::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">that others will be added ere long--&quot;of such as are disposed for eternal life.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The snowstorm delayed our train so that we missed our St. Paul-Minneapolis appointment; but the Lord provided a substitute in Brother George Draper, and the friends had a grand time.  Spelling our disappointment with an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">h</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> instead of a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">d</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> we rejoiced to learn a lesson in patience and perseverance, and pressed onward.  We have promised the dear Minneapolis friends a Sunday Convention, if possible, next time and as soon as possible.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Winnipeg, Manitoba, our next appointment, was reached in good time.  We were privileged to join in the morning Testimony Meeting, which we greatly enjoyed. The afternoon meeting for the interested was well attended and interesting.  Here again we set forth and illustrated the various features of the philosophy of the Atonement.  The evening meeting for the public was well attended.  Manitoba Hall, said to hold 1,200, was crowded--some stood and many were unable to gain admittance.  The interest was excellent to the close.  We left for our train while the closing hymn was being sung.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Hamilton, Ontario, our next appointment, was reached in good season.  We enjoyed a Social Tea with the local class and then gave a public address in the Y.M.C.A. Hall to a very attentive audience.  After a refreshing night's rest we proceeded to our appointment for Sunday, January 9, at Toronto, Canada, accompanied by about thirty of the friends.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The Toronto meetings were fine in every sense of the word.  They began on Saturday, Pilgrim Brother MacMillan having preceded, and continued over Monday, Pilgrim Brother Hersee serving then.  The report is that the friends to the number of nearly three hundred gathered from all parts of Canada and had a delightful season of refreshing.  The Sunday forenoon session was for the interested.  We discussed the philosophy of the Atonement, apparently much to the satisfaction of the hearers.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The afternoon session for the interested was held in the Royal Alexandra Theatre.  Its capacity, 1,600, was overtaxed, hundreds being turned away disappointed.  One gentleman almost had a row with the police.  He had been reading the sermon and had come twelve miles from the country and wanted to have a chance to stand in the rear, where there were already enough for the safety rules.  He was later quietly located at the rear of the stage.  The large audience gave splendid attention and we hope some good was accomplished.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We subjoin a letter for two reasons: (1) To show that there are evidently some true, ripe grains of wheat still in Babylon, and (2) to show that it requires more than one meeting and more than one tract to sufficiently arouse such to even write for further reading matter-- so strong is the prejudice and so false the misrepresentation of the Truth. &quot;DEAR SIR:--                 &quot;TORONTO, Jan. 12, 1910.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;It was my joy and privilege to listen to your lecture in the Royal Alexandra Theatre on Sunday last.  According to your invitation I am writing for a copy of your printed address on &quot;Hell,&quot; and trust same will come to hand in safety.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;From a boy I have taken a heart-interest in Christianity, and am seeking day by day to make Christ king over my life.  My soul seems, naturally, to respond to his claims, and, to sum the matter up briefly in Professor Drummond's words, I believe that 'To become like Christ is the only thing in the world worth craving for; the thing before which every ambition of man is folly and all lower achievement vain.'</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;And yet, Pastor Russell, there has been all the way through the bitter struggle with </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">doubt;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> books like Paine's 'Age of Reason' having been largely the cause, perhaps. Being a profound lover of books, and with an earnest desire for truth, naturally, as a boy of eighteen or twenty, I came in touch with literature treating the Bible from countless viewpoints.  And yet, perhaps, over and above all this, the Church's doctrine of Eternal Punishment has always been one of the main barriers to a whole-hearted acquiescence to the message of the New Testament.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Is it any wonder, then, think you, if I should appreciate beyond telling such an interpretation of the Christ message as you give?  How it seems to lift the burden of gloom, and breathe new hope for the sin-maimed victims of heredity and environment, whom the Church of old would condemn to a hopeless and terrible eternity!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The silence of the present-day Church on this subject goes to intimate that it is no longer in the thraldom of so terrible a doctrine.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4570 : page 76::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   &quot;However, Pastor Russell, there are quite a few passages in Holy Writ that are hard to understand in the light of this </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">newer</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> interpretation.  I should be, indeed, grateful to you if you could let me have any pamphlets treating this subject efficiently; also advise as to any books I might procure that would help me to a better understanding of that Truth of which Christ is the unique </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">centre.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I have desired for years past to enter the ministry, feeling that that is what I am, perhaps, best fitted for.  So far--principally through lack of capital--I have not realized my desires.  However, the way may yet be opened; and, if so, I would like to take out into a sin-darkened world the Christ evangel in all its completeness; hence the need for more light.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;I may never meet you, Pastor Russell, but I am truly thankful for having </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">heard</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> you on two occasions in this city.  I suppose it will take nothing less than an eternity to estimate the vital influence of such a life in the community.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Thanking you in anticipation of a reply, with booklets, believe me,           Sincerely,             __________.&quot;</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER RUSSELL:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The secret of the Lord (the Divine Plan) is (already) with (understood by) them that fear (reverence) him, and (in addition to this favor) he will (future tense--in due time, through &quot;that servant&quot;) show them his covenant (which, when understood, will order and classify all the features of that plan).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">It has been on my mind for some time to write to you in regard to the New Covenant, and having been requested by several brethren to do so, I gather that possibly it is the Lord's will.  But first let me express my thankfulness to the Lord, and to you as his servant, for all the truth that is shining for us clearer every day, through THE WATCH TOWER articles.  I have particular reference to the article in the Nov. 15 TOWER, under the caption, &quot;Ransom Points to Be Remembered.&quot;  To my mind the essence, the philosophy and logic of the Sin-Offering doctrine is all stated there in a few words, an unanswerable argument.  Praise the Lord!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">When Vol. 5 was published, I read it and comprehended</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4570 : page 77::</font><br />
<br />
<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">some</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of its beauties.  Some three years ago you requested my opinion of the Swedish translation of Vol. 5.  I therefore read sections of it critically, comparing it with the original.  On page 27, Studies (pages 28 and 29 Dawn), I read something which riveted my attention, that had escaped me in previous readings.  It was this: &quot;When father Adam was perfect, in complete harmony with his Creator, and obedient to all his commands, a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">covenant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between them was implied, though not expressed; the fact that life in its perfection had been given Adam...and the additional fact that ...if he would violate his faithfulness to the great King, Jehovah, by disobedience, he would forfeit his life ...--this implied, we say, a covenant or agreement on God's part with his creature that his life was everlasting, unless he should alter the matter by disobedience, and bring upon himself a sentence of death.&quot;  Thus Adam's condition before he fell was a </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">covenant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> condition. To this agrees `Hosea 6:7` (margin and Revised Version), &quot;They have all like Adam broken the covenant.&quot;  This thought is the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">key.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(1) Adam was in covenant relationship with Jehovah, Vol. 5, SCRIPTURE STUDIES, page 27 (pages 28 and 29 in DAWN).  It was not a covenant or agreement in words, but an agreement of Adam's whole being with God's law, a oneness resulting from the fulfilling of mutual obligations --God supplying life and its blessings, Adam rendering obedience.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(2) Adam broke this covenant condition (`Hos. 6:7`, margin and Revised Version).</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(3) God's plan is to restore the race into this oneness, this covenant condition, which Adam lost.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(4) This (future) perfect union or covenant condition was foreshadowed in and by an imperfect (typical) union or oneness between God and Israel.  The Law was &quot;a shadow of good things to come.&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(5) The Law Covenant was made on (or during) the &quot;third day&quot;--two days being preparatory.-- `Exod. 19:10,11`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(6) The New (Law) Covenant will be made during the Millennial &quot;day&quot;--the Jewish &quot;day&quot;--the Gospel &quot;day&quot; being preparatory.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(7) Moses was the Mediator or &quot;go between&quot; of the Law Covenant.  He went back and forth between God and the people, making known God's terms, and bringing back their response.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(8) The Christ will be the Mediator or &quot;go between&quot; of the New (Law) Covenant.  He will make known to the world God's terms for human sonship and covenant relationship, and bring back their response.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(9) The title of Mediator applied to Moses </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only while</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Covenant </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">was being made.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">  Only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;at that time&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> did he stand </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;between&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> God and Israel as </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mediator.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (`Deut. 5:5`.) His prominence afterwards in Israel's affairs was in great measure due to the imperfect covenant he established, which necessitated the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">repetition</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of its prominent features, renewing the covenant yearly, on the atonement day.  In these </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">repetitions</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> Aaron represents the Mediator in his sacrificing and subsequent blessing the people, while Moses represents the Law--Justice-- which the Mediator satisfies--a different type from that of the &quot;third day.&quot; (`Lev. 9:23`.)  TABERNACLE SHADOWS, page 82, last paragraph, and page 83, first paragraph.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(10) The Christ will be the Mediator </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">only while he</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (gradually) establishes the New Covenant, but his prominence will (like Moses') continue after his mediatorial work is ended.  He will, for instance, be Jehovah's agent in destroying the unworthy ones at the close of the Millennial Age, and be highly esteemed to all eternity by the restored world.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(11) The Jews were blessed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a Law Covenant on the &quot;third day&quot; and were blessed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it for a whole age (in proportion to their faithfulness to it).-`Rom. 3:1,2`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(12) The world will be blessed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">with</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a New Covenant being gradually made during the Millennial Day, and will be blessed </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it to all eternity, an </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;ever&quot;-&quot;lasting&quot;</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> condition of perfection and union with God.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(13) `Jeremiah (31:31-33`) states that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">making</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the New Covenant </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">consists</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of a writing of God's law in men's hearts.  When the law has been fully written, the union, not only of their wills, but of their whole being, with God will be accomplished--the covenant condition being fully attained.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(14) Before this New Covenant or perfect union between God and men can be consummated, a twofold work must be done.  (1) The &quot;book&quot; must be sprinkled-- Justice must be satisfied, and (2) the people must be sprinkled (cleansed, restored--see WATCH TOWER, 1909, page 110, second column, paragraphs 2-4).--`Heb. 9:19,20`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(15) The New Covenant will thus be mediated for a thousand years, and consequently will not be in force as a finished thing until the end of that time.  THE WATCH TOWER, 1909, page 110, first column, paragraph 2, expresses this thought thus: &quot;And it is consequently after the Gospel Age, when they are pardoned freely for Christ's sake, and </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">restored to the condition of sinless</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">perfect manhood,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> that the New covenant </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">comes into</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">force.</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(16) God has never entered into covenant relationship with any who have not first been both justified and consecrated.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(17) Abraham must be justified (by faith) and consecrated (by circumcision) in order to be in covenant relationship with Jehovah.--`Gen. 7:9-14`.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(18) Israel must leave Egypt (type of the world) and be freed from the dominion of Pharaoh (type of Satan and sin), and they must be (typically) consecrated,-- &quot;baptized into Moses&quot; (Vol. I, STUDIES, page 279, paragraph 2), before they could enter into a (typical) covenant relationship with Jehovah.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(19) As </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">reckoned</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> justification ceases with the end of the Gospel Age (Vol. 6, STUDIES, page 112, paragraph 1), the world must be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actually</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> justified and consecrated in order to enter into covenant relationship with Jehovah. Their consecration is the antitypical circumcision on the antitypical eighth day.  They will prove their full consecration by standing the test coming to them in the &quot;little season&quot; which is the beginning of the eighth thousand-year day.  (This thought was expressed by Pilgrim Brother Paul Johnson.)</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(20) In the type, females were ignored.  Only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">males</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> were received </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">into</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the Law Covenant, by circumcision, on the eighth day.  In the antitype, at the end of the seventh thousand-year day, the beginning of the eighth thousand-year day, only </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">males</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> will be received </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">into</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> the New Covenant --restitution having previously lifted them to Adam's condition before he was divided into sexes.

<font size="2" face="Verdana">(21) The </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Law</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was one thing, and the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Covenant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> based upon that Law quite another thing.  See WATCH TOWER 1894, double number (Oct.), treating the Sabbath.  The Law was the terms, while the Covenant was the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">condition</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> which followed, a condition of oneness and harmony. While the Jews were &quot;under&quot; the Law, under obligations to keep it, they were not &quot;under&quot; the Covenant, but </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it. The Scriptures do not speak of any being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> any covenant, nor do they give that thought, but always </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4570 : page 78::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">covenant--</font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> obligations of law in order to be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> a covenant condition of blessing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(22) The English usage of the word mediator forbids the thought of mediating a covenant after it has been made.  To illustrate: Russia and Japan were at war with one another.  After awhile they were willing to consider peace negotiations, but according to international customs and rules they could not directly confer with one another, but only through a third party, a</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">::R4571 : page 78::</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">mediator.  Ex-President Roosevelt volunteered this service, and by and by peace was concluded.  The President then stepped back, his mediatorial work was finished.  He had </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">effected a covenant</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> between the two parties.  It would be untrue to say that he continues to mediate this covenant or agreement all the time it lasts.  So with Christ: He will not establish the New Covenant at the beginning of the Millennial Age and then mediate it afterwards, but the New Covenant will be the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">result</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of his work.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(23) The Law Covenant was a failure, as far as giving life was concerned, because Moses introduced the people in their imperfect condition into covenant condition with Jehovah, and, being unable to keep the Law, the base of their covenant condition, they were condemned to death.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(24) The New (Law) Covenant will be a success because the Christ will make mankind perfect </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">before</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> he will introduce them to Jehovah, into covenant condition with Him, when they can fully keep that Law upon which the New Covenant will be based.  If the New (Law) Covenant were made with mankind at the beginning of the Millennial Age, or at any time during that age, its Law, being applied to them when they entered the Covenant, would condemn them as the Jews were.  And since the world will not then have </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">imputed</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> righteousness, they will be in a more or less sinful or imperfect condition. THE WATCH TOWER, 1909, page 314, column 2, paragraph 2, expresses this same thought that God cannot enter into any covenant with sinners, which corroborates the foregoing.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(25) From the time that Moses killed the animals whose blood was used in making the Law Covenant-- from that time and on he was the mediator of it until he had consummated it--he was actually working on the first feature of it.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(26) The opponents of the Truth point us to the present tense of `Heb. 9:15` and `12:21`, etc., and think they have an unanswerable argument for their view.  But allowing the present tense, as we must do, is not that very thing the strongest argument against their theory? To illustrate: Mr. A. is building a house.  From the time that the spade is stuck in the ground to excavate for the foundation, the actual work having begun, Mr. A. can truthfully be said </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">to be building</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> (present tense) his house, and may be spoken of as the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">builder</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the house, although there is no framework in sight yet.  So Christ, from the time he took the first </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">actual step</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> towards making the New Covenant is engaged in working on it--on its first feature, satisfying Justice--laying the foundations of the house, so to speak.  And since the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">type</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> was due to cease when the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">first actual work</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> on the New Covenant was begun, it follows that no difficulty is encountered in saying that the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">typical significance</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the Law (not the Law itself) ceased when Christ presented his sacrifice at Jordan, thus giving full play to `Heb. 10:9`.  See WATCH TOWER Bible comments against this verse.  And as Mr. A. has no house to live in until he is through with building it, so there is no New Covenant for men to be brought into as long as the Mediator is not through with his work of making it.  In other words, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Where there is a</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">mediator, there is a covenant in progress, but not consummated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">yet, and where there is a covenant consummated</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">there is no longer any mediator, his work being</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">done.</font></b><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(27) As in building a house there are three stages, (1) laying the foundation, (2) the actual building of it, and (3) the dwelling in it when finished; so the New Covenant.  (1) One age is consumed in satisfying Justice; (2) Another age in the actual making of the covenant [bringing of men into line with its provisions-- EDITOR], and (3) Mankind being </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">in</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> it [in covenant relationship with God--EDITOR] to all eternity.  What a wonderful covenant it must be when it takes two ages to make it!</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(28) While the typical significance of the Law Covenant ended when the antitypical Mediator came and began to work on the New Covenant, the Law Covenant itself did not cease, and will not cease as long as Abraham's posterity continue to bind themselves to it by being circumcised on the eighth day.  The condemnation feature thus rests upon them yet.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">(29) The opponents accuse us of taking off the wedding garment.  But on the contrary, </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">they</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> are doing that very thing theoretically.  If a man, after attaining perfection at the close of the Millennial Age, should say, &quot;I need a mediator,&quot; would he not ignore and deny his perfection? He surely would.  But the perfection which the world will attain to actually at that time is reckoned to us now.  If we, after being justified, reckoned perfect, should say, I need a mediator, would we not ignore and deny our reckoned perfection?  It surely would seem so. With much Christian love,</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">DEAR BROTHER:--</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Your letter is much appreciated.  I am in very good accord with it.  Incidentally I might say that although the New Covenant will not reach full operation until the close of the Millennium, nevertheless the </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">blessings</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> of the New Covenant will begin to go into effect as soon as the great Mediator shall have applied the merit of his sacrifice &quot;for all the people.&quot;  This blessing will begin with the Ancient Worthies, because they already are acceptable with the Father.  Under the New Covenant provisions they will immediately get the blessings of restitution to human perfection.  They will represent Israel and thus the blessings will proceed through Israel to all mankind.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">The mediating of the New Covenant with mankind during the thousand years of Christ's mediatorial reign will mean the gradual bringing of the willing and obedient nearer and nearer to the standard of human perfection-- by the rewards and punishments of that &quot;day of judgment.&quot; The world will be </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">under the blessed provisions</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">and experiences mediated for them by The Christ,</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"> but will not be individually introduced to the Father--brought into covenant relationship with God.  At the close of the Millennium the perfected world (all rebels being destroyed in the Second Death) will be introduced to the Father on the covenant terms of full regeneration of both mind and body at the hands of the Mediator.  Thus it is written, &quot;I the Lord will give thee for a covenant of the people.&quot; (`Isa. 42:6`.)  In other words, while the Covenant will not be in a finished or completed condition until the end of the Millennium, its blessed provisions for the uplift of mankind will operate from the time the Millennial reign begins.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">   In the interest of readers in the uttermost parts of the earth, we note the fact that the time for the celebration of the Memorial Supper this year will be the evening of Friday, April 22, after six o'clock, which marks the beginning of the 14th day of the Month Nisan according to Jewish reckoning.  That night corresponds to the one on which our Lord was betrayed.  The following day corresponds to the date of his crucifixion, and Sunday, April 24, beginning at 6 p.m., on the 23d, will be the first day of the Jewish Passover week.</font><br />
<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">We refer our readers to the Sixth Volume of the &quot;Scripture Studies,&quot; Chapter XI, entitled &quot;The Passover of the New Creation.&quot;  There we have endeavored to set forth this subject in detail.  We hope that all of God's dear people who trust in the merit of the precious blood of Christ for justification will celebrate this Memorial of the great Sacrifice of our Lord.  And let us not forget that it also memorializes the consecration to death of all the members of the Body of Christ.  &quot;If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.&quot;  &quot;If we be dead with him, we shall also live with him.&quot;  &quot;This cup is the New Testament in </font><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">my blood</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">.&quot;  &quot;Drink ye all of it.&quot;  &quot;The cup that I drink of.&quot;--`2 Tim. 2:11,12`; `Luke 22:20`; `I Cor. 11:25`; `Matt. 26:27`; `Mark 10:38`; `Matt. 20:22`.</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Pure gold and well refined, to our poor vision</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     These loved ones seem; and oft we wonder sore Why souls who seem to us each day more saintly</font><br />

<br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">But the dear, loving Lord who tries the spirit,</font><br />
<font size="2" face="Verdana">     Sees in them what no human eye can see-- A further fineness where his gracious dealing</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">As in a portrait by some cunning artist,</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Labors, because before his inner vision</font><br />

<font size="2" face="Verdana">So with these precious souls.  Men see their graces,</font><br />
