<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">f*TT </span><span class="font8">IS said that more than $1,750,000,000 </span><span class="font9" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aJC,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> A </span><span class="font8">are stolen every year from the people of the United States,” declares District Attorney Banton, of New York. This huge sum is divided up as follows: $150,000,000 are lost through commercial frauds; $600,000,000 are lost through fraudulent claims against insurance companies; and $100,000,000 through worthless securities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While most of this money is kept in circulation, the greater part is diverted from legitimate channels of industry, and is, therefore, injurious to the people in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The population of the United States on January 1st, 1924, is reported as being 112,826,000. This is a gain of 1,943,000 in one year, and a gain of over 7,000,000 since 1920. The net in' crease of the population of the United States is <sub>x</sub> greater now than at any time in the history of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' While big business has fought high wages for the workers and advocated the open shop to dis-rapt and dissolve union organizations and otherwise manipulated industry in an effort to make labor eat out of its hand, a news item of interest says that a change of sentiment is gradually coming over big business, that big business has seen a great light. It now recognizes that high wages increase efficiency and production. One statement says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;Intelligent and skillful labor, equipped with the '■. best machinery, can give lower production costs at high wages than inefficient labor at the wages prevailing in Asia. Wages rise in all countries as the labor becomes more skillful and productive, just as prices of all goods tend to be adjusted to economic values.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This statement is credited to a monthly business review made by the National City Bank of New York. Whether it represents a true change of heart of big business or whether it is mere political propaganda to be made use of during the coming campaign, is not for us to determine</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font8">FFORTS continue to be made to stop the smuggling of liquor into this country from Canada. A convention(an agreement less important than a treaty) has been signed by representatives of the two governments which provides not only for the suppression of the smuggling operations, but also for the prosecution of persons who violate the narcotic laws of either country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Supreme Court has handed down a decision which gives tenants certain rights over landlords. Tenants have often been ousted to, pave the way for the landlord to demand higher rentals or to get more desirable tenants. It was supposed that the landlord had a right to dispossess any of his renters at any time by merely saying that he wanted the apartment for his own use. The court has decided that if any one is ousted the landlord must pay the cost of moving and also the differential in a higher rent cost for the first thirty days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">While the Bonus Law was passed by Congress over the President's veto there are agencies at work to cause it to be inoperative. The first effort in the courts to invalidate the law was begun recently in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, when Benjamin Catchings, a lawyer of New York filed a suit to prevent the expenditure of the money needed to pay the bonus. Mr. Catchings’ contention is that the law is unconstitutional; so we may expect a long legal fight before it is finally disposed of. There is also an Ex-service Men’s Anti-Bonus League that, aS*its name implies, is against the payment of the bonus. It is argued that the Adjusted Compensation Act is in fact a mere bonus or gift^ and not a provision for the payment of any debt or compensation owing in money by the United States; and because of this it is assumed</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">that the law should be declared unconstitutional.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8">S WAS expected, President Coolidge was , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• nominated for the presidency of the United</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">States on the Republican ticket. Gen. Charles </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">G- </span><span class="font8">Dawes of Illinois, author; of the Dawes Reparation Plan, was chosen for his running mate. The old tactics of stampeding a convention were indulged in when ex-Governor Lowden was chosen for second place on the ticket. But Mr. Lowden refused the nomination. He had dedared repeatedly that he would not accept the nomination for the vice-presidency. The Republican politicians wfere bent on drafting him and forcing the nomination upon him; but he remained firm to his pre-convention declaration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Cleveland </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Press,</span><span class="font8"> after watching the maneuverings of the bigRepublican convention, significantly asks: “Will 1924 see the last of the conventional conventions of the political parties This is not because it sees the fulfilment </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">prophecy, but because the tactics and demonstrations pulled off for &quot;favorites” are decidedly </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font8">of date; for they fool nobody and are meaningless to thinking people. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Press</span><span class="font8"> concludes by saying, &quot;The show is growing stale. Something new is needed to fool the multitude.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Republicans failed on four planes, according to W.J.Bryan. These four planes are as follows: The Religious plane; the Intellectual plane; the Financial plane; the Reform plane. Besides this terrible failure, according to Mr. Bryan, they fell down on making a platform; for it is not concrete and specific but deals with generalities and dodges the acute problems.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Farm Bureau, in a talk at a luncheon of the Music Industries Convention at the Waldorf-Astoria, New York city, made the statement that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">farmers of the United States have been waging </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">great contest for equality under the protective system of the Government for nearly, four months; and he admitted that when Congress adjourned the farmers had lost the fight. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">He </span><span class="font8">said; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">&quot;The outlook of agriculture is as dismal as it has ever been in my lifetime, notwithstanding what those outside the industry say about it. The people hack in’the rural districts are a little bit inclined to be resentful—altogether an undesirable and undefensible situation to have under the flag of our common country.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. </span><span class="font8">Murphy called attention to some legislative acts which are against the farming interests, and named some of them, as follows: The eight-hour-day law; the Adamson law; the : transportation act; the tariff law, the Federal : Reserve act; and ho stated that these, together ? with the Labor Board and the Coal Board, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font8">all interferences on the part of the Government that have riveted chains upon agricultural ~ America. No doubt the sentiment of the farmer will be reflected in the November election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The farmer's plight is shown in a recent survey, which extends over a period of five years, ' j and takes in the price trend of ten crops and 3 five classes of livestock and livestock products. It shows that the cost of what the farmer has had to buy has increased one hundred percent; ■ what he has to sell has increased but thirty-one ■ percent; and the purchasing value of the dolldr as compared with 1914 is only seventy-One per- , cent.</span></p>

The canal has led to a great increase in business between the ports of the eastern part of the United States and all the ports bordering upon the shores of the Pacific ocean. Students of the traffic which passes through the canal say that the temporary stimulation of Far Eastern trade caused by the Japanese earthquake is no longer in evidence.</span></p>

The Republic is now seeking the construction of standard gauge rail lines from the capital to the Atlantic coast. An American syndicate has proposed to build such a line if the Colombian Government will turn over to them an issue of government bonds at a discount of twelve and one-half percent, plus two percent commission, plus hundreds of square miles of agricultural, petroleum, coal and ore lands. In other words, the American financiers are willing to build the road if the Colombian people will virtually give their country away into the hands of strangers, and relinquish all hope that themselves and their children profit by the treasures which nature has placed in their land. Naturally the Colombian people are , not very enthusiastic about the American offer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The center of the American colony in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Japaw </span><span class="font8">is the Imperial Hotel in Tokio where, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">every -</span><span class="font8">Saturday evening, it is the custom of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Ameri* ; </span><span class="font8">cans to gather for a dance. A week ago this dance was broken up by the Japanese, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font8">invaded the dance floor, armed with swords* and who in the most vulgar and insulting language demanded the deportation of all Americans, the boycott of all American goods, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">the abrogation of all Japanese-American treat-' ies.

<p><span class="font8">Two days after the breaking up of the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ball&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">in the Imperial Hotel, a Japanese visited the office of the American Consul at Yokohama, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and stated</span><span class="font8">stated his intention to kill the American Consul unless the latter would agree to intercede </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font8">the </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Am</span><span class="font8">erican Government regarding the exclusion bill. Guards have now been placed about the Embassy and the Consulate, and also about the Imperial Hotel, in the effort to prevent further outbreaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">What may constitute the entering wedge that will lead the United States into war with Japan, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">the claim upon the United States Government njade by Japan immediately after the Exclusion 'Act, that thereby the United States Government has violated the treaty of 1911, which gives &quot;liberty of entry, travel and residence” to both peoples.* Secretary Hughes denies that the treaty of 1911 in any way limits the United States from dealing with the immigration question as it sees fit. Every war must have a pretext, and it seems quite possible that Japan is seeking a pretext.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">j The leader of the new government, Viscount Kato, is perhaps the most hostile to the United ’ States of any of the great statesmen of Japan. ’ It is he who drew up the notorious twenty-one ; demands on China in 1915; and it is likely \ that his advent to power may result in war between Japan and the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In Japan there has been until now some sort of restricted ballot; but the Japanese are now demanding </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">immediate and universal suffrage for the men.

<h5><a name="bookmark38"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark39"></a>Personal Responsibility as to Taxes</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">P</span><span class="font8">EKCHANCE the inspector has a business which depends largely upon the good will of the public. So rather than to offend these patriotic (T) road workers and their friends, 'the bill<sup>1</sup> is allowed. Thus an extra burden of additional and unnecessary taxes is laid upon - the tax-payer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Here we have a clear illustration of how in-Gdividual righteousness might lessen the cost of ^frovernment. Let those who are clamoring for ®&lt;ax reduction take notice. Tax reduction, like charity, should begin at home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“We love your children better than you do,” was a slogan used by some childless promoters of a rural high school proposition in one com-<sup>1</sup> munity. This was absolutely false. In the old days, under the management of teachers who * had to stand rigid examinations in the common branches and in school government, and who were willing to work for somewhere near the income their patrons were getting, we had better schools than we have now, under the super; vision of our high-priced, high-school graduate faddists; and we turned' out stronger students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Nearly every little hamelet now has its $60, 000 to $225,000 school buildings; and the money these schools have brought into the towns, together with the other money the farmer has put into circulation, has combined to make the in- habitants more prosperous than they have ever been before. Naturally, they are strong for progress (?) and the present order of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&gt;■ When all this money began to roll in, a big “merry - go - round” was started, upon which &gt;■ every one but the farmer can ride. Because he ■ is the only person who cannot fix the price on / what he has to sell he can not get on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">;, The riders are having the time of their lives, their only fear being that the farmer will quit his very useful occupation and hop upon the wheel. The extra weight might break the machinery; and all would then be forced to climb off and get down to real work and plain living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">* To the thinking person, it is no mystery why : freight rates are so high. The railroad companies have their proportion of these high taxes ___ to pay; and, in addition, they have thousands of employes who must have wages sufficient to enable them to maintain the “American high standard of living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of course, it would never do for these companies to feel the weight of the increased expenses ; so the bill is passed on to the shipper. The farmer has virtually voted high transportation charges upon himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is not more credit that the farmer needs. It would have been a blessing if he never could have borrowed a dollar. He would then, at least, have been his own “boss” with no one to say to him, &quot;Sign this,” or, “Vote thus and so.” If the farmer would get his business on a cash basis as quickly as possible, and keep it there, instituting a “pay as you go” system to govern all his affairs, both public and private, we sincerely believe that he would soon force all other businesses into their proper sphere and thus accomplish much towards establishing the just balance so necessary to the satisfactory adjustment of this world’s affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">ANY farmers should take advantage of’ the bankruptcy law, and start life afresh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There is absolutely no use in their floundering * about in the quicksands of debt when every struggle puts them in deeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Then, instead, of sending their children to high school to be polished and entertained, let them put them, as well as themselves and their wives/' to work, thus giving them a practical education&quot; , and a taste of the joy of useful accomplishment. The higher education is a luxury, not a necessity. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Young people everywhere should be encbur-aged to obtain knowledge; but all institutions of higher learning should be self-supporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For their own good, able-bodied children who have finished the grades should not continue -to be objects of charity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Children must be taught early to feel some responsibility for their own maintenance, if we are to reduce the present output of egotists and youthful criminals. Work under proper conditions and fox reasonable hours will not injure any normal child. In times past, we have overdone child labor; but now, in many sections of the country, we are going to the other extreme of no work at all, much to the moral detriment of the on-coming generation. After these bankrupt families, by their united efforts, have at- ' tained comfortable, not luxurious homes, let <sub>; </sub>them do the honest thing, and lay aside, funds ’ with which to requite to past creditors what was lacking in the amount due them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We are well aware that we are advocating a stern remedy. But we believe that the farmer's case is serious; that his troubles have their source in the usury (interest) system, which was forbidden by Jehovah in the early days of the Jewish nation, and which later became established in this world's affairs; and that the sooner he realizes his condition, quits taking the nostrums and optimistic soothing syrups</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">administered to him from the newspapers, the ' pulpit, the platform, and the entertainment 2 halls, and faces the situation squarely, the better-for himself and all concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rg</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Cooperations and federations </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">are only at- / </span><span class="font8">tempts to shirk individual responsibility. God. J has spoken the doom of such in Isaiah 8:9,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The lesson may be bitter; but it </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is needed to ? </span><span class="font8">teach men to use their God-given powei$ </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">think, not suffering themselves </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to be driven </span><span class="font8">hither and thither like ships without </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rudders^J^</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE prospective purchaser of a radio receiving set today has small chance of making an intelligent selection, for the reason that he is confined almost exclusively to advertisements or &quot;inspired” reading notices for his information. Occasionally he can listen in on a neighbor’s set to help make a choice; but even then he is Hable to make a mistake, as so many conditions affect the operation of a receiver. The only real test, obviously, is direct comparison; i. </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">e.<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font8"> with the various receivers attached to the same aerial and ground and using the same tubes, batteries and headsets. By changing from ’ one instrument to another periodically during an evening one could notice the difference in quality, volume and range as well as selectivity. Of course, this is impractical usually; so one is confined to buying on faith, and unfortunately often is disappointed. The reason is not hard to find. The persistent and ’ almost exclusive but unwarranted use of superlatives to describe radio products, and nonchalant announcements of transcontinental and transoceanic reception lead the uninitiated to expect more from a moderate-priced receiver in the home than is possible today in the well-equipped laboratory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From time to time accounts are read of extraordinary performance, and one is led to infer that it is commonplace. Adding to this the tendency of the average owner of a radio receiver to exaggerate and herald to his neighbors a record performance as an everyday occurrence, it is easy to see why buyers are frequently disappointed when they have bought a really good product worth all they pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The virtues of receiving apparatus most stressed in advertising are selectivity, sensitivity, clarity and volume; and each and every instrument from $10 to $500 claims exactly the same results. No other term but &quot;maximum*' will do; maximum range, maximum volume, maximum selectivity; etc. Obviously this cannot be true. Whom are we to believe 7 The answer usually is the &quot;Big Name&quot;; but unfortunately the buyer frequently goes wrong in this. Sometimes &quot;Big Advertising” creates &quot;Big Name”; and as usual the consumer pays the bilL</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark44"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark45"></a>Points to Bear in Mind</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">H</span><span class="font8">ERE is an unbiased statement of what may be expected of a good radio broadcast receiver: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sensi</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:line-through;">tivit</span><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">y (range): Consistent reception, the ability to duplicate at will on any normal night in winter is limited to approximately 1,000 miles, assuming a 500-watt transmitting station. When conditions are unfavorable, this distance is greatly lessened; while under extraordinarily favorable conditions it is not uncom</span><span class="font8">mon to reach out 2,500 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Selectivity : The limiting factor is simplicity </span><span class="font8">of control. A highly sensitive receiver with not too highly complicated control can select stations within a range of three miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Volume and Clarity: For really great volume without distortion we are still looking. Volume too great for headsets up to 500 miles is common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stability: Little is said about one </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of the </span><span class="font8">most important points of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">any radio receiver— </span><span class="font8">stability. One should, after properly tuning </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">in a </span><span class="font8">station, be able to enjoy it indefinitely </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">without</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">■ further adjustment. But this is rather uncommon. The craze today is for what are known as &quot;trick” circuits—make one do the work of two, etc., which really means something for nothing. These generally carry names made up of syllables from names of some of the &quot;world beaters” designed to push sales. Most of these circuits &lt;&nbsp;* give Wonderful results when they function prop-7 erly, which is seldom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Use the same reason in buying and operating </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">radio receiver as you would a motor car. In motor cars maximum speed means </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">high-</span></p>

(19) theotherapy; (20) thermo therapy; (21) viaviotherapy. All these therapies have cured patients or they never would have existed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I have cured patients allop athically, biochemically, chiropractically, dietotherapically, homeopathically, hydropathicaliy, limotherapically, osteopathically, physiotherapeutically, psychother-apically and theotherapically, even when our health board crowd failed to cure. Therefore I am opposed to one school of healers being empowered by our government to boss and rule out all other schools of healers, as the allopathic school of which the Board of Health now consists, is being allowed to do; for all other schools heal often when its healers fail. Moreover, I am most heartily opposed to the allopathic or any other school of healers having unlimited and unregulated control of the health and people of our government, for the reason that each school is too ignorant at its best. Therefore, since the allopathic school is now already empowered unduly, and<sup>1</sup> also is seeking absolute control of every one and everything, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">shall dearly show that its ignorance is too great to be allowed even what it has already Mecured of power and control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The cells of the human body are now supposed to be the basis, or units, of its life; and hence any displacement of their natural workings causes an irregularity in their normal life that may end in a permanent disease, or diseases, or death, or both. The full chemical structure and balance of the cells and their vibratory value, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">also their true differentiation and individ</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ual </span><span class="font8">power to receive and to resist, are all unknown; even that mysterious something that makes it possible to see what is within the range </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">vision through the best microscopes. No one therefore can know what a drug, vaccine, or </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">serum may </span><span class="font8">do towards unbalancing, disorganiz-</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">ing and destroying normal cells. Dr. Broadhurst, a professor in biology in the Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, declared : <sup>,f</sup>We are still very far from an adequate comprehension of the activities of bacteria.&quot;— “How We Resist Diseases,” page 19, for 1923.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All will admit that nothing will excel or even equal normal cells; and therefore, what a tremendous risk to impose upon them drugs, vaccines or serums to better what is already normal and perfect! Cells are not alike in size, power to receive, to resist, endure, or to do; and therefore what some may be equal to, others may not be equal to the same.' This is why drugs, vaccines, serums, etc., disease people and kill them. This is why people die so immediately with croup, diphtheria, heart failure, pneumonia, influenza, paralysis, etc., when drugs, vaccines, serums, etc., are administered. The first time I witnessed the administration of a serum for croup, it killed the child in about fifteen minutes after given. The child was not suffocating from the false membrane forming, neither did it die from suffocation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This is why some die quickly when pneumonia serum, diphtheria and other serums are given. That is why Karnsner, professor in pathology, and Ecker, professor of immunology, of the Reserve University, of Cleveland, Ohio, declared in their book, “Principles of Immunology,” pages 282, 283, that a serum that may immunize a dog will not succeed in human beings; and, too, declared that it has been estimated that only six to ten percent of untreated persons bitten by rabid animals, die. In Europe seven of 169 bitten by rabid animals were treated with the serum, and three died; tad of 162 untreated, not one died. In Baltimore, Md., eight persons were treated; and the three that were not bitten through their clothes died, while the five bitten through their clothes did not die.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Despite the boast of stamping out yellow fever, no one knows its cause. All that is known as to its cause is simply its transmission by the mosquito called </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">Stegomyia,</span><span class="font8"> which has to bite </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">yellow fever patient before it can give yellow fever to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">person. Hence the medical world </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">still ignorant as to how the first patient must get it so that mosquitos can carry it to others. Its origin is still in ignorance; and there is no great</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">science displayed in isolating yellow fever patients and the killing of mosquitos. There was no forced diseasing and murdering of the people to stop yellow fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In vaccination for smallpox, Jenner, the accredited beginner of vaccination, vaccinated his own son at eighteen months with hogpox in November, 1789, and declared it to be a preven. tative of smallpox. Afterwards he declared that the virus of grease, a disease of the heels of horses, whether taken directly from the heels of . horses or from a cow infected with the same disease/ would protect the rest of our lives. , Hence he was believed, and his vaccination con-tinned until 1898, when spontaneous cowpox * virus was used. Now both spontaneous cowpox virus and smallpox virus are used; and besides we now have as many as fourteen vaccines. Where vaccination has been made compulsory the death rate from smallpox has gone from 10,14 and 18 percent to 65 and 85 percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The most rigidly vaccinated countries without regard to sanitation, have the most small-• pox; but those countries that have given proper attention to sanitation and less attention to vaccination have had fewer deaths from smallpox. . Hence Dr. C. K. Millard, health officer of Leicester, England, could wisely declare that smallpox - lessened or declined in proportion to the neglect of vaccination, and in proportion to proper attention given to isolation and sanitation. (See Journal of American Med. Assn., Sept., 1923, page 1125.) In his book, &quot;The Vaccination Question,” page 150, he admits comparative &quot;</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">immunity</span>” to smallpox of unvaccinated infants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">On page 105 of his book on &quot;Drug Action,” ' Dr. Sallmann, in the University of Cleveland, Ohio, declares that Ehrlich’s Side Chain Theory had not been proven to be true. He also said that vaccines or toxins might destroy cells. Dr. Millard, a vaccinationist, in his book, &quot;The Vaccination Question,” page 52, published in 1914, said of Japan : 'Tn spite of vaccination, revaccination and extraordinary vaccination, in spite of this great vaccination, 80,000 took smallpox and 23,000 died from 1896 to 1910.” After vaccination and revaccination in the Philippines from 1898 to 1919, smallpox seized 107,981, and 59,741 died just in 1918 and 1919.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;The Hygeia,” a health journal of the American Medical Association, in its November, 1923, issue, declared of Japan, a well vaccinated and / revaccinated country: &quot;There have been epidemics since vaccination began.” But it failed ' to publish that from 1889 to 1908 Japan had 28,280 deaths, and from 1917 to 1920 it had 3,397 deaths, despite its rigid vaccination and even its sanitation. If rigid isolation and sanitation had been practised, and vaccination let -alone, it could have said what Meridian, Miss., has been able to say for seventeen or more years, that since it has stopped compulsory vaccination and given attention to sanitation, ijt has not had a smallpox epidemic during that ; time; and also ns Leicester, England, with its 250,000 people, without compulsory vaccination for more than thirty years, having given attention to sanitation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Last November in Gloucester, England, within fifteen miles of where Jenner was born, reared, and began his vaccination curse, officers were elected who did not believe in compulsory; vaccination nor in vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Let the diseasing, murderous practice end forever, and especially compulsory vaccination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Of antitoxin, Dr. Karnsner and Dr. Ecker in their book, &quot;Principles of Immunology,” page 42, declare: &quot;The exact nature of antitoxin is unknown”; and Dr. Leathers, in a letter to me on September 28, 1923, said: &quot;It is well to emphasize that ten percent of the children who take three required inoculations, at least one week apart, of toxin-antitoxin, are not </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">immunized</span>. Antitoxin once was declared to immune, . but now it is declared that it is effective only after diphtheria develops.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The best institutional doctors make more than seventy-two percent of errors in diagnosis o£ diseases, and in general practice more than seventy-seven percent. (See Journal of the American Medical Association, October 8,1921, page 1209.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Doctors do not know the origin of eight different skin diseases, much less the character of smallpox, vaccines, scarlet fever, cancer, etc. Therefore can one not see how unwise it is to put our children, ourselves and all others into the hands of boards of health to carry out their ignorant experiments with diseases and deadly -vaccines on us, with state authority? Surely we. shall not be so lacking in wisdom. Surely we ‘ shall stop such casualty and injustice!</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark48"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark49"></a>The Purpose of the Animal Creation </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">l. c.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Parrott</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">0 DOUBT all people of questioning minds, ’ especially those who have reached years of maturity, have often wondered what useful purpose has been served by such an infinite variety of living creatures as we see on the earth. In the case of many of these it is hard to see what benefit they have been to the earth or to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Reasoning from the Scriptural statement that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">earth was not created in vain, but formed to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">inhabited (Isaiah 45:18) and intended to remain forever (Psa. 104:5; Eccl. 1:4), and that man was created to have dominion over it and everything upon it, and was given the command </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth (Gen. 1:26-28), we get the thought that man is designed to be its permanent inhabitant. Other living creatures have served a temporary purpose, to fill in a gap, as it were, until the time when the earth as a whole will be in a suitable condition to be a permanent home for man.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Evil Beasts to Become Extinct</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">E UNDERSTAND also that all these various living creatures have each had </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">part in helping to bring the earth into a suitable cpndition to be man’s everlasting’ home; and when they have served their purpose they will pass away except such of them as shall be found not to interfere with man but to minister to his use and pleasure. As a proof of the last statesmen! note the prophetic words of the Almighty in Ezekiel 34:25, that He “will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land; and they [men] shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In order to get a full grasp of the situation it seems necessary to carry our minds back to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">Azoic age, to the time (approximately 48,000 years ago) when the first work began with this earth to prepare it as a habitation for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">man. </span><span class="font8">Without going into all the evidence we will merely say here that we think it a reasonable presumption that the earth was at that time in a partly molten and partly gaseous condition. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">At </span><span class="font8">that time all the various metals—gold, silver, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">copper, </span><span class="font8">iron, etc.—were in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">gaseous condition, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">along </span><span class="font8">With all the elements that now compose our oceans, seas and lakes, in dense masses of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cloudy vapor, </span><span class="font8">surrounding the central molten nucleus, aiid possibly extending out from the center as far as the moon is now.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark52"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark53"></a>Plant Life as a Purifying Agency</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE </span><span class="font8">cooling process went gradually on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">until, </span><span class="font8">on the third “day,” or epoch (over </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">14,000 </span><span class="font8">years from the start; for apparently each “day” .i </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was 7,000 </span><span class="font8">years in length), a crust </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">had formed </span><span class="font8">and solid land began to take shape apart from the waters on the surface of the earth; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">gradually, as soon as conditions became </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">favorable for their growth and development, certain -■&gt; of the lowest forms of plant life began to appear, such as were suited to the prevailing e atmospheric conditions. Gradually, as condi-tions became more favorable, other forms of plant life made their appearance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;3</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As climatic and atmospheric conditions pro- q gressed, earlier forms of plant life passed away, . ;5 because not adapted to the changed conditions, while other and more varied forms appeared, as. \ conditions became more favorable for each kind. &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">At that time it is evident that no breathing creature, such as we know, could have existed; for alj such require a large amount of oxygen in the air they breathe, and this element was lacking in the atmosphere at that time. Not only so, but the atmosphere was so heavily laden with carbon in its various forms as of itself to prohibit the existence of any animal life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is known that oxygen has a great affinity for other elements, and probably did not exist in a free state in the atmosphere originally, but only in combination with other earthy elements. It is understood, therefore, that the purpose served by the various forms of plant life is. to absorb oxygen, along with other elements, from the earth; and that in the absorption processes ■ of the plant the oxygen is freed from the other elements, and given off into the air through its leaves. It is also known that all forms of plant life absorb free carbon from the air.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Animal Life Serves Its Purpose —</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HIS process, then, of absorbing the excessive carbon from the atmosphere and freeing sufficient oxygen to support even the lowest forms of animal life, must have required a long time. Vegetation must have been very rank when all the great coal and oil deposits wore laid. So we read that it was not until the fifth “day” (over 28,000 years from the start) that there began to appear some of the lowest forms of animal-life.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">Gradually, as climatic and atmospheric conditions became more favorable, other and more varied forms of life came on the scene, while earlier forms passed away, each suited to certain conditions, and gradually passing away as those conditions changed, giving place to others more suited to the newer conditions. It is even conceivable that some of these may have been so constituted as to be able to adapt themselves more or less to the changing conditions; and. that such changing conditions of food, climate, etc., might require slight changes in structure, thus giving a seeming corroboration to the theory of evolution.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark56"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark57"></a>Man Brought on the Scene</span></h6>
<p><span class="font8">OWE VER, it is quite evident that all climatic changes were not gradual by any</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">means. Some of these changes were very sudden and radical. But gradual or sudden, the process went on, until at last at the end of the sixth &quot;day” (approximately 42,000 years from the start) conditions became sufficiently favorable ... (although still 7,000 years from the permanent perfect condition to be reached finally) that man was brought on the scene, as the crowning fea<sub>&gt;</sub> ture of the earthly creation, and was made king of earth, as described in Psalm 8:4-8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus all the varied forms of plant and ani-' mal life, from the lowest to the highest, have each had a part in the process of preparing the earth to be man’s permanent habitation. Even the lowly earth-worm and the ant, as well as other creatures that burrow in the earth, have each assisted in bringing up portions of earth</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">from beneath and depositing them on the sur- i face; thus eventually, through many thousands of years, bringing about a loamy, friable condi- J tion of the surface soil, making it more favorable for cultivation and the growing of- crops useful to man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' _ _</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">VEN man himself, during the time he is getting an educative experience with evil, &lt;&nbsp;and fighting the thorns and thistles of the still imperfect earth, is helping to bring it to the promised Edenic condition. By building great irrigation and great drainage works, by harnessing rivers for the generation of power, and in various other ways he is assisting in bringing about the desired result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus, in about 1,000 years hence, and 49,000 years from the time work started, the earth by '■ all these means will have been brought to its settled permanent condition, and will be perfectly adapted to be man’s everlasting home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Thus we see that each age or epoch works out the sovereign will of the great Creator. Each creative &quot;day&quot; serves its purpose towards the final grandeur and beauty which God has designed. Changed climatic conditions will undoubtedly come within the next thousand years, taking away all the ice from the polar regions, and causing even those barren lands to spring forth with verdure. Unquestionably, many of the animals familiar to us now shall become extinct, <sup>i </sup>while those which are to be man’s companions and for his pleasure will be conserved and thus multiply and become plentiful.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark60"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark61"></a>Chimney Swallows </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By J. </span><span class="font11" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;"> Bohnet</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">VER the city of Natchez, Miss., architec. turally fully fifty years behind the times, ^*on any fair evening of early October one can witness thousands of chimney swallows flying to and fro from, one hundred to five hundred z feet above the buildings, circling seemingly ■ hither and thither aimlessly in the twilight, and chirping as they go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">After about an hour’s flight they gradually assemble themselves in the vicinity of the Edu-&lt; cation Institute, estimatively 30,000 of them, - until the air is darkened by their numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For an hour the writer has stood and watched the wonderful maneuvering of these birds, anticipating that some of them will surely bump into others in their swift flight. But although the sky was black with swallows, in not a single instance was one seen to touch another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Finally the maneuvering resolves itself into a vast milling of the entire flock around and about one of the big chimneys of the Institute; and as the milling continues a solid stream of birds is seen entering the chimney until practically the entire flock has disappeared within the big flue. Presumably the first ones to enter go to the bottom, where they cling to the inner walls and build themselves upward to the top, literally lining the flue with a living lining. The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">last </span><span class="font8">several dozen apparently could not secure </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">footing; for they continued milling about the chimney top until darkness obscured the sight. * Evidently no standing room was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Hundreds of pedestrians stop on the streets to watch the imposing sight and to talk about ’ it. One old lady remarked; “Oh, just look </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font8">z the sparrows!”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Linings </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">(Contributed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">HEN I was a little girl I once read a story about a saloon-keeper's wife whose husband bought her a beautiful fur coat. The lady was so pleased with it that she dreamed about it. She dreamed that some one held up the eoat before her admiring eyes; and then, as she looked, the garment was slowly turned around until sho could see the inside. The lining was made up of the gaunt, hungry faces of the wives and children of the drunkards whose money had </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">paid </span><span class="font8">for the coat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are linings and linings. Everybody </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">everything has a lining of some sort. The Bible speaks of people's linings as “the inner man” or &quot;the heart.” A society's lining is the spirit of the organization. A company operating commercially calls its lining “policies”; and frequently it has two such, an outer one more or less for the public eye, and an inner one, known only to those who put it there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Strikingly true, as usual, are the words of the Bible: &quot;Man looketh upon the outward appearance.” Only a few have acquired the understanding heart that looks below the surface and sees the lining. As a result there is much injustice in the world. Praise is often given when censure would be more in order, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">As to the inner man: I knew a little girl now grown to womanhood. She has always dressed so. simply as to cause comment. She cannot skate; she cannot dance nor play tennis nor golf. To use the language of those who see only the outside, “She cannot do anything.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When she was a child she loyally helped a peevish, complaining mother to bring up the younger members of the family; and now she spends her all taking care of her aging parents. No; she cannot do anything, except reverse the rule to which we are accustomed and to put that which is unlovely on the outside and the beautiful on the inside, whence in time it must shine out, as indeed it is already doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Excessive daintiness or expense in dress, much handiwork, undurable </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or unnecessary </span><span class="font8">accessories, overfurnished homes, overloaded * tables—what sort of linings do these indicate for their possessors? Stop, look, listen; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font8">J you will find that in every case the lining is \ the same: Selfishness and thievery, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">conscious ' </span><span class="font8">or unconscious. • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Indulgence in extravagant or useless practices &nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>r</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">or things is just so much harm done to the com- ' munity as a whole. If in a family one member is lazy and shirks his tasks, all the others </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">must £ </span><span class="font8">work harder to make up for the one's delin-queney. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- ; 5</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">No doubt the delinquent one has time </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">grow plump and beautiful; no doubt he </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">has  </span><span class="font8">time to be leisurely and good-natured.

Even under present &quot;&nbsp;imperfect conditions all could be moderately * beautiful and comfortable if all did their share.' /</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I know a man, a big, wide man, whose grand- ' father and father were in the liquor business. s’ Feeding upon the blood of others, they were rich; and the big, wide man received a liberal &gt;&nbsp;education, wore fine clothes, got a good job, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">pat</span><span class="font8">ted himself upon his capacious stomach, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">bought </span><span class="font8">an expensive car, and smiles good-humoredly upon everybody. Oh, he is a lovely man! </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">So </span><span class="font8">refined, so educated, so prominent, so well- : dressed, so distingue, so exclusive! Could </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">peo-&lt; \ </span><span class="font8">pie but bring themselves to recognize the lining! <sup>J </sup>Do we admire vermin or any other parasite because it is fat and shiny? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*«</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">As to organizations: Just now there are only \ two that come forcefully to my mind, religious ' denominations and political parties; and they, alas t can be classed only under the next heading, which is</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark62"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark63"></a>Companies Operating Commercially</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">O</span><span class="font8">F ALL the wicked and sinful things, of all the evils that make for cynicism and sor-- didness, the commercialization of our highest -ideals stands first. Love, honesty, and fidelity i are discouraged and oppressed in this world of selfishness. How welcome to every honest heart will be that kingdom which will soon reverse the old order!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">’ Today the churches are empty, and newspapers are obliged to urge people to use their right to vote. Why? The people are discouraged. Their going to church shows no good resuit; their balloting accomplishes nothing. When we go through a certain succession of . movements, we want the expected effect to follow; or we quit. The general belief is that neither the teachings of Christ nor the ideals of the prophets are possible of fulfilment. Consequently it is &quot;each man for himself”; and , with the balancing ideals gone, &quot;the world reels l. to and fro like a drunken man.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>7</sup> If the world could realize that it is not the . fabric (the Bible), but the lining (the selfish clergy and their false doctrines), that is at fault</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">i they would take heart and try again. The spirit ? of the organization is wrong. The leaders are in it for money, personal honor, influence, and not because they love the cause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">T </span><span class="font8">SEEMS to me that this is the laboratory of human mischief. Presidents and senators, . and governors and mayors—how great they are, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">how </span><span class="font8">much honor they receive; for all the world likes the man whose father and grandfather were in the liquor business. Public benefactors ? Of courseI</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">I am only a woman, and not supposed </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to ba </span><span class="font8">able to understand politics; just like a' man </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">know who says that his business is so complicated that only he can run it. I have watched him and his business carefully, and have concluded that he is right. He has &quot;engaged in so many dishonest transactions, and told so many lies, that everything requires his personal attention in order to keep up the artificial conditions he has created; and the effort has made him tired and old before his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">There are other businesses more legitimate and less flamboyantly and outrageously commercial; selling soap, for instance, through the -use of a lot of &quot;soft soap” showing how beautiful you will become if you use so-and-so’s soap. Does the manufacturer earnestly desire to see you beautiful? Oh, no! he wants the profit he gets from selling soap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">&quot;Honesty is the best policy,” say some business men. They are honest, not for the love of honesty, but because they believe that people ’ will buy from a person whom they trust. After all, when honesty is a policy instead of a prin- <sup>v </sup>ciple, it merely veils the lining, which is a selfish love of money, the root of all evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many regard the success of the united charity &quot;drives” as a proof that the world is getting better. A business man explained his liking for them thus: “ It is a lot easier to be solicited to </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">give once</span><span class="font8"> a year, to write out one cheek and be done with it, than it is to be bothered one hundred times a year. It doesn’t cost sq much, either.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Similar to this is the spirit that often underlies the much-vaunted welfare work among employes. The inter-organization clubs that nobody wants to join, the picnics and dances attended by the workers only for fear of offending the employer—why does the latter like them? It makes good subject matter for an occasional write-up in the paper; it is good advertising to have his company’s athletic teams frequently mentioned as competing with others. And the corporation is patted on the back for its nobility, and gains customers on the strength of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">My experience with so-called welfare work <sup>1 </sup>and social work among the workers has led me . to the conclusion that-it is often little short of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">tyrannous, unwarranted intrusion upon </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the. </span><span class="font8">spare-time hours of the employes for the company's financial benefit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Why the Farmer Does Not Come Back </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">By a Farmer’s Wife</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE truth is that the farmer is taxed and “interested” to death. I use this term advisedly; for surely the existing conditions mean the end of prosperous agricultural business for very many farmers. ’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">From time immemorial, the farmer's work has occupied so much of his time that little was </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">left for </span><span class="font8">the study of any subject not directly concerned with his particular occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Generally, he considered the political and civic machinery as beyond his powers of comprehension, and did not worry his head much over them. He usually embraced the political and religious faiths of his father, although, if particularly hard times prevailed through one administration, he might be caught voting for the other side at the next election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Any farmer who did have a studious turn soon found his fences down and the cows helping themselves to his corn. The result was that he depended upon his banker, his lawyer, or his preacher for advice on subjects not directly concerned with agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">All went fairly well, however, until the World War brought a little wave of prosperity to these sons of the soil. Soon a luxurious crop of farm advisers sprang into existence. The farmer was advised, educated, and entertained to the limit; and the end is not yet. Even his old standbys proved false and joined with the others in urging upon him moves which, it seems very likely, will prove to be his ultimate undoing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">“Build modern homes, buy tractors, trucks, cars, and other conveniences, build big barns and sheds, and go into business right, even if</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">you have to go into debt to do so. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We never &lt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">made money until we got into debt. With </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">better </span><span class="font8">7 farming and a larger acreage the debt will </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font8">■7 inconsequential,” said these self-appointed -guardians of the farmer’s welfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>s</sup> 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To the joy of the lumber and cement </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">com</span><span class="font8">panies, the automobile, tractor, and other machinery companies, the furniture and musical ■ instrument companies, and so on down the lin% ) the advice was taken. A boom in farm lands </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">precipitated; and many.farms were purchased at exorbitant prices, often with but little </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cash ; </span><span class="font8">paid down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Prosperity seemed to be smiling on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">every </span><span class="font8">side; but the final results were not so satisfac- &gt;&nbsp;, tory. With over-production, and consequent low prices, compared with expenses, the interest money comes in slowly, indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">To make matters worse, when the furore </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font8">7 non-taxable securities came, the farmer </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">persuaded, coaxed, and even driven to vote </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font8">community into huge bonded indebtedness, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">both &quot;&nbsp;</span><span class="font8">for roads and for schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In a vast section of the country paved </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">roads </span><span class="font8">are absolutely unnecessary. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font8">few days of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">con-^tf </span><span class="font8">scientious labor yearly would keep each mile in good passable condition for very nearly, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">if not * </span><span class="font8">altogether, as many days as paved roads can boast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>A Lost Paradise</span></h5>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">ILTON'S “Paradise Lost” has been called “the epic of mankind.” Webster defines the word epic as follows: “Narrative poetry treating </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">theme of action in heroic style.&quot; We would naturally expect, therefore, “Paradise Lost” to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be a </span><span class="font8">wonderful exposition of paradise, pointing </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">the true hero, Christ, who is ultimately to restore paradise to the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But in reading “Paradise Lost,” we find some queer things. Satan, the adversary of God and man, is the hero! His strong characteristics stand preeminent over all the other characters. Evidently, as a character study, “Paradise Lost” is a miserable failure. We are not here attempting to criticize it as a literary work of art; for its literary supremacy is unquestioned. However, we purpose to take up the facts of the case, believing that fact is far more important than fiction or “literary value”. If we find that the poem is at variance with the facts of the case, then it is time to change our minds regarding “the epic of mankind”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">But where shall we go for the facts regarding the beginning of our race? There are various ideas and theories too numerous to mention. Heathen religions present the most weird and unreasonable views imaginable. Nor can Greek or Roman mythology offer any better solution of the mystery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Turning to history, what do we find? The history of the oldest Gentile nations can be traced back clearly and distinctly less than three thousand years. Farther than that, all is dark, uncertain, mythical, fabulous, and untrustworthy tradition. Professor Fisher, of Yale University, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“An exact method of establishing dates was slowly reached. The invention of eras was indispensable to this end. The earliest definite time for the dating of events was established in Babylon—the era of Nabonassar, 747 </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">B. </span><span class="font6">CJ The Greeks (from about 300 B. C.) dated events from the first recorded victory at the Olympic games, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">776 B. C. </span><span class="font6">The Romans, though not for some centuries after the founding of Rome, dated from </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">that</span><span class="font6"> event, or </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">753 B. C ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We learn from the “American Cyclopaedia” that histories of ancient nations, except that of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">Hebrews, go ,back into mythical periods of thousands or millions of years; and that even after the records begin to assume an historical aspect, the discrepancies are very great. The</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Assyrian, Babylonian, and Egyptian inscriptions are in extinct languages, and in&quot;characters generally well authenticated to the first Olympiad, 776 B.C. and the establishment of the Consulate, 510 B.C., previous to which they are mainly traditional or legendary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident, therefore, that many so-called “histories” of the remote past so abound with vagaries and mythical traditions as to make them valueless, and wholly unworthy of consideration, so far as the facts of the beginning of mankind are concerned. Thus history is unable to furnish the information we desire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Evolution Theory Untenable</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">0 </span><span class="font8">OME claim that man, animals, and even the earth itself, developed gradually, by process of evolution. We do not here purpose to go into detail regarding the evolution theory. But bear in mind that the evolution theory, at its best, is still a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">theory.</span><span class="font8"> We are not attempting to examine theories, but facts. The “missing </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font8">,” so necessary for the support of the evolution theory, has never been found; nor are scientists any nearer finding it today than when the theory was first formulated. History does not record a single instance of monkeys changing into men, although the latter have been known to make monkeys of themselves at various times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We will have more to say of the evolution theory later. In the meantime, we will show the true source of information on this most interesting question—the beginning of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">We believe that the Bible is the great Creator’s revelation to mankind of His plan. In it is contained the story of man's creation and fall. It contains the answer to the all-important questions, “Why do people die?'* and “Why are there so much sickness, sorrow, pain, and trouble upon the earth ?” -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Clinton, in his work on Grecian Chronology, says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">“The history contained in the Hebrew Scriptures presents </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">remarkable and pleasing contrast to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">the early </span><span class="font6">accounts of the Greeks. In the latter, we trace with difficulty a few obscure facts preserved to us by the poets, who transmitted, with all the embellishments </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of poetry </span><span class="font6">and fable, what they had received from oral tradition. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font6">the annals of the Hebrew nation, we </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">have authentic narratives, written under the guidance </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">of inspiration. What they have delivered to us </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">comes, accordingly, under a double sanction. They </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">were aided by</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">divine inspiration in recording facts upon which </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">as mere human witnesses, their evidence would t&gt;e valid”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Bible is, therefore, the only book in the world which furnishes a view of human history as a whole. It carries us from the lost paradise of Genesis to the restored paradise of Revelation. The Bible, alone, is the chart of all history. Without it, as has been truly said, history would be 'Tike rivers flowing from unknown sources to unknown seas”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Turning to the Bible, we find in the first three chapters the story of the creation of the earth and the vegetation upon it, of the creation of the animals, birds, fish and, finally, of man. Adam was placed in the Garden of Eden, a perfect home, with perfect food and surroundings. He was given dominion over the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea. He was given a helpmate, who was called Eve. There was but one restriction placed upon them. They were forbidden to eat the fruit of one tree, not because there was anything wrong with the fruit, butmerely as a test of obedience; for God has the right to demand obedience of all His creatures. But having had no experience, they fell under the temptation, and were driven out of the garden. Before we proceed, however, we must consider a few<sup>1</sup> points that are not entirely clear to some.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Chronology Aids in Understanding Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">ANY do not accept the Bible account because it states that the creative work lasted only seven days. Scientists claim that the formation of the strata of the rocks and other parts of the earth consumed a period of thousands of years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The word &quot;day&quot;’ is not limited in its meaning to a twenty-four-hour day; we speak of Chaucer’s day, Shakespeare’s day, Milton’s day, Washington’s day, etc. In the Bible, we read of &quot;the day of temptation in the wilderness”—forty years (Hebrews 3:8,9), and of the &quot;day of judgment”—one thousand years. Thus a &quot;day” may be a fixed period of time of any length. Although we do not have a direct statement as to the length of these &quot;creative days,” we are safe in assuming that they were uniform periods; that is, each one was of the same length as any other of the creative days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The &quot;seventh day” began with the expulsion of man from paradise, and is to end when paradise is fully restored to the world. The Bible chronology shows this to be a period of seven</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">thousand years. Over six thousand years </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">this day are gone, with the final thousand in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the? </span><span class="font8">future, in which will take place the work of restoring paradise. Even today we see evidences;-of the beginning of this work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Chronology thus helps us in establishing the; length of these days. Seven days of seven thou* sand years each make a period of forty-niner thousand years, the &quot;creative week.” Only six days, however, elapse from the time the stafp^ ment is made that &quot;the earth was without forth,<sup>4</sup>, and void,” to the time when paradise was lost,' or a period of forty-two thousand years. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The fact that the sun, moon, and stars were, not visible until the fourth day was probably due to the fact that the earth, in its formation, had &quot;rings” around it, much the same as Saturn; has today, obscuring the views of all, heavenly bodies from the earth. It does not mean that they were not created, but that they were not<sup>1 </sup>yet visible to the earth. This fact that the sun<sub>Y </sub>was not visible until the fourth &quot;day” should be proof enough to anyone that the &quot;days” were not. twenty-four-hour periods of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">So, after all, the Bible is in full harmony with science on the subject. The preparation of the earth for man’s habitation has actually taken thousands of years, and still goes on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Many believe that man was made merely to’ go to heaven, and that the earth will be burned, up. Such is not the Biblical testimony, how*-ever; for we read, &quot;The earth abideth forever”; (Ecclesiastes 1: 4) God formed the earth to be inhabited, and not in vain. (Isaiah 45:18) If : the earth was formed to be inhabited, it must be* man that is to inhabit it. &quot;The heaven, even the heavens, are the Lord’s: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.”—Psalm 115:16.<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the Bible speaks of “the end of the world,” it means plainly the end of the order of: things now existing or the end of the present unrighteous systems. Thus a new &quot;world” began . in France at the end of the French Revolution^ This is the correct thought with reference to f the &quot;worlds” of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is well to bear in mind that the earth was made for man, and that man was made for the -earth. Sin, sorrow, sickness,' pain, and death; are all unnatural; remove the unnatural, and earthly life will be perfectly happy. That these -unnatural things are to be removed eventually is shown very clearly in Revelation 21:3,4.</span></p>

When paradise is restored, the whole earth, instead of one little spot, will be a beautiful garden.

<p><span class="font8">c' Adam was created perfect, “very good,” with * full access to the trees of life, thus signifying that if he had never sinned, he would have been f living today; nor would any of his children have died or had trouble of any kind. This is man’s , natural state—a state of which we know nothing by experience. The only other perfect man ' that ever existed on earth was Jesus, who died for Adam to redeem him and his race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">■ But, as we have said, Adam’s continued existence was dependent upon his obedience. He was explicitly told: “Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not  eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof, - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dying thou shalt die.”—Genesis 2:16,17 </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">margin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The language here used does not imply that</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">man had an immortal soul, or that he would suffer eternally after death. The only place where there is a hint of continued existence regardless of physical death is found in Satan’s r &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lie—the first lie ever told—recorded in Genesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">v &nbsp;&nbsp;3:4, where we read:, “And the serpent said</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">Following Eve’s example, thousands of wellmeaning people have been deceived into thinking that, after all, man does not really die when &quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physical death ensues, but that his soul lives on</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">.theories regarding hell, a prominent one being K portrayed vividly in Milton’s “Paradise Lost”.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">for the recovery of heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The creeds present to us a hell filled with millions of sinners, suffering horrible agony. ' In heaven there are a few saints playing upon their golden harps, and singing, “Praise God from whom all blessings flow!” while they are looking down into hell, enjoying the plight of their brothers and sisters.

<p><span class="font8">No person of intelligence today can approve of such a God or of such a. plan. This doctrine of eternal torment has caused more infidelity than any other doctrine. Even heathen religions have a better outlook for the future than this 1</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>Come, Let Us Reason Together</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">A</span><span class="font8"> PERSON of authority has said that Milton’s &quot;Paradise Lost” has led more people into a belief in a hell of torment than the Bible itself. Then where does the blame for the inii-delity and confusion of today rest? What a narrow theology prevailed in Milton’s day, that led to the writing of such God-dishonoring ideas! The less said about it, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The reason that the, poem deceives anyone is that Milton apparently gets his ideas from the Bible. But in this enlightened day, it is time for us to prove our beliefs and, above all things, to use reason. This is in harmony with the Bible teaching, &quot;Come, let us reason together, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 1:18) “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.”—1 Thessalonians 5:21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">First of all: Is it reasonable that God wotild create man immortal, death-proof, permit him to fall into sin, and then torment </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8"> forever, knowing in advance that man would sin? What could be the purpose of such torment? Could it accomplish any good? Would it result to the glory of God? A man or a child would not even torture his horse, his dog, or his cat. It seems strange that men with reasoning faculties should ever reach the conclusion that the allwise Creator would eternally torment any of His creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In the second place: Are the doctrines of the immortality of the soul and eternal torment Scriptural? We answer: Nothing unreasonable is Scriptural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Was Adam created mortal or immortal? Before we can answer this question, we must know what ismeant by “mortal” and “immortaL” The following definitions are taken from good authority :</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19240730_files/g_E_19240730-12.png" alt="" style="width:22pt;height:188pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<div><img src="g_E_19240730_files/g_E_19240730-13.png" alt="" style="width:19pt;height:179pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">' &quot;Immortal</span><span class="font6">—the state or condition in which death is Impossible—</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font6"> death-proof condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;Mortal</span><span class="font6">—a state or condition in which death is possible; a condition of liability to death, but not necessarily a dying condition unless a death sentence has been incurred.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Now if we say that man was created immortal, or with an immortal soul, we are immediately in difficulties. For instance: How was he threatened with death, and afterwards sentenced thereto, and how could he die, if he were deathproof? And why did God, in punishing him, drive him out of the garden of Eden, away from the life-sustaining grove or trees of life, lest he, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">by eating,</span><span class="font8"> would live forever?—Genesis 3:22, 23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Therefore if these questions cannot be satisfactorily answered, we must conclude that Adam was created mortal. In fact, he was plainly told that his everlasting life was </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">conditional</span><span class="font8"> upon his obedience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some, however, have the idea that the word &quot;mortal” signifies dying; in other words, that anything “mortal” must die sometime. If this definition be true, we are again in difficulties. How could God sentence man to death after his disobedience if he were already a </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">dying</span><span class="font8"> creature and never had been otherwise? And if Adam was created dying, how could God declare that his death came by his sin?</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Adam Created Mortal Being</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font8">ONFUSION is unavoidable unless the proper definition of the word “mortal” is clearly recognized—</span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font8"> able to die, but not necessarily dying, unless a death sentence has been incurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">It is evident, then, that Adam was created mortal, yet he could have continued obedient and lived forever in perfect happiness. Even the angels are mortal; for do we not read that Satan is to be destroyed? (Hebrews 2:14) How can, anything be destroyed that is indestructible? Evil angels will eventually be destroyed; but the angels which remain loyal to God will live forever in their heavenly home, and still be mortal. &quot;God only [originally] hath immortality.”—1 Timothy 6:16.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Christ received immortality as His reward in His resurrection, and this condition is also the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">reward promised to faithful Christians. It </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">nowhere hinted in the Bible that human beings are immortal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The matter is very clearly stated in the creation of Adam: &quot;God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”—* Genesis 2:7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The body was created, then animated with the breath of life, or air; and, as a result, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">man became a living, moving, thinking, breathing crea-., ture—a soul. Therefore we cannot correctly say: &quot;Man has a soul” but rather, **Man ts </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">soul.” When God pronounced the penalty upon Adam, He was talking to Adam, the moving, thinking soul, the being who sinned. Therefore r it was the soul which received the death penalty.. “The soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18 : 4, 20) “The wages of sin is death, but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">gift of God is eternal life.” (Bomans 6:23) “Fox. evil doers shall be cut off: but those that </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">wait </span><span class="font8">upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Fer </span><span class="font8">yet a little while, and the wicked shall not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">be: </span><span class="font8">yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">it shall not be”</span><span class="font8"> (Psalm 37:9,10) “The Lord preserveth all them that love him,- but </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">all the </span><span class="font8">wicked will he destroy.”—Psalm 145:20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This should be proof enough to any reason- . able mind that death, not eternal torment, is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">wages of sin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">E MUST remember that the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the New Teatament was written in Greek. The word “hell” is an English word sometimes selected by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">translators of the English Bible to express the sense of the Hebrew word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> and the Greek word </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades.</span><span class="font8"> The same words are also sometimes translated “grave” and “pit”. The word “hell” in an old English usage, before it received its special meaning from a twisted theology, ' simply meant “to conceal, to hide, to cover; hence the concealed, hidden, or covered place.” The word “help was, therefore, properly used synonymously with the words &quot;grave” and &quot;pit”, as signifying the death or hidden condition </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These words, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol</span><span class="font8"> and </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font8"> mean the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">grave </span><span class="font8">—the condition of death, or oblivion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Instead of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">place of blazing fire, *it is </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">de</span><span class="font8">scribed as a state of “darkness” (Job 10:21); _ instead of a place where shrieks and groans </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ara </span><span class="font8">heard, it is described in the context as a place of “silence” (Psalm 115:17); instead of representing in any sense pain, suffering, or remorse, the context describes it as the place of forgetfulness. (Psalm 88:11, 12) “There is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">[sheol],</span><span class="font8"> whither thou goest.”—Ecclesiastes 9:5,10.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8">The Bible hell, then, is the grave, where the world quietly sleeps until the resurrection blessings come. (John 5:28; Acts 24:15) What a different picture from that presented in “Paradise Lost” I</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">If there is, indeed, '&quot;no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol” (hades),</span><span class="font8"> then it is a very deluding picture which we have in Book Two of ‘&quot;Paradise Lost.” Here Satan and all his fallen, angels are pictured in “Hades,&quot; hatching devices galore! Some advise another hattie for the recovery of heaven; others advise stealth. Finally a plan of Satan's is brought forward, suggesting that they regain their lost possessions by first deceiving man, “soon to be created.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Satan Not in Hell</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">E</span><span class="font8">VIDENTLY there is something wrong. Why does Milton make the mistake of thinking that, when Satan and his angels fell, they were cast into </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">shades?</span><span class="font8"> He probably did not understand the correct meaning of the word. Since it means the condition of oblivion or death, the opposite of life, we know at once that, when Satan and his angels fell, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">they were not cast into hades;</span><span class="font8"> for Satan has been anywhere except in a condition of oblivion during the past six thousand years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Theologians of Milton’s day misunderstood the meaning of the following scripture, found in 2 Peter 2:4: “God spared not the angels that ' sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered ^;hem into chains of darkness, to be reserved Kttnto judgment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The word here translated “hell” is not </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">sheol </span><span class="font8">or </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">hades,</span><span class="font8"> but another word entirely foreign in meaning. It is </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">tartaroo.</span><span class="font8"> This is the only text where this word occurs in the Bible. It means a condition of restraint, and carries with it the thought of falling from the favor of God. The thought in this text is that Satan and his angels fell from the favor of God, and were placed in comparative bondage, “chains of darkness,” or bondage of wickedness; that is, their</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">activities were confined exclusively to this earth. And so we find it: Satan, instead of being ofE somewhere “stoking fires,” is right here among us, deceiving the unwary into believing his lie to mother Eve, and into believing such doctrines as eternal torment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Milton presents also a queer account of Satan’s entrance into Eden to tempt Eve. Why the “guardian angel” permitted him to go ahead after stopping him cannot be explained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Turning to the Scriptural testimony on the subject, we find that Satan, before his fall, was a wonderful, beautiful being, called Lucifer. “Thou hast been in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou -art the anointed cherub that covereth; and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I </span><span class="font8">have set thee so; thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore, I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O </span><span class="font8">covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty.”—Ezekiel 28:13-17.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These verses show that Lucifer himself was the guardian angel of Adam and Eve and was, indeed, a good and beautiful heavenly creature. He was “in Eden,” “the anointed cherub that covereth,” perfect in his ways until iniquity was found in him. Isaiah 14:12-14 shows that it was pride and ambition which led to his downfall. He betrayed the trust which was given him. His fall, therefore, came </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">after</span><span class="font8"> the creation of man, instead of before, as presented by Milton. There was no “battle”; God simply pronounced the sentence, and Satan’s activities were confined to this earth. We will see later why he was permitted to tempt mankind.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark74"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark75"></a>Symbols Have Symbolic Interpretations &quot;</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">M</span><span class="font8">UCH confusion has resulted from </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a literal </span><span class="font8">interpretation of the symbols of Revelation and of some of Jesus’ parables. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Bible</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">uses &quot;fire and brimstone” as.a symbol for complete destruction. We bum things to destroy them. We would not think of burning anything . alive. The Scriptures explain themselves on this point: “And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.” (Revelation 20:14) This symbolical &quot;fire” must be understood in the study of Jesus’ parable also; for if we are to apply the language of the parable of the sheep and .the goats literally, we must be consistent and say that it applies to literal sheep and literal goats—a position which no one would accept. If &quot;sheep” and &quot;goats” are symbols referring to certain classes of people, then the &quot;fire” is a symbol of complete destruction. The principle of </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">consistency</span><span class="font8"> is a safe one to follow in the study of the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Orientals speak in symbols much more than we do. The Bible is a book of symbols. Often more truth can be embraced in a simple allegory than in volumes of technical, theological works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Some insist that the story of the creation of the earth and man, as recorded in Genesis, is an allegory. There might be grounds for this belief, if it were not for the fact that in the New Testament Jesus’ genealogy is traced back directly to Adam (Luke 3:23-38); and real, live human beings do not spring from allegories! St. Paul says plainly: &quot;Wherefore, as by owe </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font8"> [Adam], sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12) &quot;For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.”—1 Corinthians 15: 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">This shows that death and all its accompanying ills, sorrows, pains, and tears have come about because of Adam’s sin, and that their removal is entirely dependent upon the work of Christ. This is directly antagonistic to the evolution theory, which claims that by his own efforts'man is getting better all the time. By thus ignoring the, necessity of Christ’s work, the advocates of this theory &quot;deny the Lord that bought them” (2 Peter 2:1) If we accept the Bible as God’s Word, we must accept the Scriptural testimony, believing that God knows more about His creation than we do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Furthermore, the Bible shows that in the future there is to be a restitution of all things which were originally lost. (Acts 3:19-23) Now, if man were originally a monkey, a restoration to the former state would be anything but desirable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Object of Jesus’ Coming <sup>r</sup></span><span class="font8"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, • g</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HE correct thought is that Jesus came to</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">earth to redeem Adam and his race (Luke 19:10; 1 Timothy 2:5,6), and to give all an $ opportunity for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A clear understanding of man’s be- ? ginning is, therefore, important, in order to understand what is to be restored. perfect life, health, freedom from sin will be man’s happ^^ lot in the future, when God’s work is done. ? Labor-saving machinery, invented within the : last fifty years, is evidence that the curse which was placed upon our race will soon be removed: * &quot;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.” j —Genesis 3:19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Not only the living, but all who have died will \ come back to these blessings. &quot;There shall be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">resurrection of the dead, both of the just and' unjust.” (Acts 24:15) Thus, all that die or <sup>1 </sup>suffer because of Adam’s sin will have an opportunity for life. Then will be fulfilled the prayer of the Christian, &quot;Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In restored paradise &quot;God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no | more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither -• shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.”—Revelation 21:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">In conclusion, we will say that we are not trying to impugn Milton’s motives in thus criti- ; cizing &quot;Paradise Lost” as we have done. Possi- d bly he did not intend his words to be taken 'r seriously, but was merely creating a &quot;literary ; work of art.” Nevertheless the fact remains that the poem has been taken seriously by some j who are not so familiar with the Bible as they ;■ ought to be. By claiming to get his ideas Out J of the Bible, Milton has led many people astrav^p on the points we have enumerated, especially^ confirming their belief in the blasphemous doo-trine of eternal torment. From this standpoint, ‘ the poem has done far more harm than good. <sub>2</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When Milton comes back in the resurrection, when “the earth shall be filled with the knowl- &gt;&nbsp;edge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters <sup>3 </sup>cover the sea” (Habakkuk 2:14), then,will he know that the great Creator of the universe is indeed ■ a God of wisdom, justice, power, and &quot;&nbsp;love.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">L The merchant who carries an account at a £ bank, and who is compelled to borrow money to U^arry on his business, is required by the bank pay four percent monthly, or forty-eight t percent annually, for all money borrowed; and if his business is poor and he is forced </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font8"> over-f draw his account </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font8"> the bank, the rate of in-v terest is increased by the bank to eighty-four percent annually.

Thus the</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">। banks are forcing the business men to be prof-<sup>1</sup> iteers, and the rank and file of the common people are the victims. All this has no tendency to sweeten the disposition of the people. Socialism, Communism, and other forms of radicalism । are ever on the increase. The tide of discontent rises higher and higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The press was recently filled with statement's r concerning the Dawes Plan of reconstruction. The banks have adopted the gold mark at a fixed price. It is purely fictitious. It is purely a fiat money. There is nothing back of it. The gold mark is bound to fail, and the Dawes Plan will be a complete failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">These conditions are of course alarming to the financiers and to the statesmen. These are . rushing into the arms of the ecclesiastics, par: ticularly into the Papal church, hoping there to find some means of appeasing the wrath that is falling upon them, or to find some shelter from the impending storm. Their hearts are failing them for fear, because of what they see coining. , There is but one class in all Germany that is . content. This class ’ is composed of the few people who have turned their hearts fully to the ■ Lord, and are patiently waiting for the estab! lishment of His kingdom of righteousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Practically All Classes in Despair</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">W</span><span class="font8">HAT is said of Germany particularly applies to Roumania, Hungary, Czecho-Slo-vakia, Austria, and other countries of Southeastern and Southern Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Italy is ruled by a fanatic who plays one day . into the hands of the Papacy and against that . system the next. Mussolini and his followers have no real confidence in or love for the Papa, cy. He is mad for power and glory, and throws &gt;&nbsp;some sop to the ecclesiastics for a sinister pur: pose. Some day this radical element will turn ; and rend the ecclesiastics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">. Spain it, undoubtedly the most flagrantly wicked government on earth. She is ruled by a dictator who is supported by a police force ofl criminals who are without conscience or sense of justice. If a citizen is suspected of a crime, he is arrested; and if he fails to confess all the wicked practices of the ancient inquisition are resorted to by these criminal officials to obtain the desired information, which is more often 699</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">misinformation wrung from the victims to save their lives. Heavy guns are dropped upon their toes; their finger nails and toe nails are pulled out with pincers; their flesh pinched with pincers ; they are hung up by the neck until almost 'dead; they are let down only to be hung up again and tortured until a confession is wrung from them. Because of fear of losing their power and</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">control over the nation the profiteers, and the politicians, and the clergy have joined hands together to keep' this wicked practice in vogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Freedom of spech is unknown in this land oP darkness, and he who dares raise his voice in protest is quickly disposed of. Recently one of Spain's greatest educators and a professor of her University, moved with righteous indignation because of the wicked practices of the present ruling powers, called attention to this in a public address. The result was that he was arrested and taken away, and is supposed to be languishing in prison; but many believe that his body is mouldering in the dust.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">\ - France won the war; but she is threatened <sup>1</sup> with a greater danger. Her experiences in the Ruhr have proven unprofitable. Her statemen and rulers, who guided the ship of state during the war, have been ordered to stand aside, and the radical element is now in charge. The finan’ tiers are fearful, and the value of her currency continues to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">' The British Empire, without doubt the greatest world power under the sun, is putting on a bold front while shaking in her boots. Her politicians and financiers have builded a great exposition at Wembley, a suburb of London. It </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">the most imposing thing of its kind yet built. All of her Colonies are represented there, magnifying her wealth, her political ^and ecclesiasti</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">cal </span><span class="font8">organizations. It is truly a desperate attempt </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font8">impress the people with the greatness of the power and prestige of the Empire. Fear and perplexity have driven the rulers to take this step. The casual observer might say: Surely an empire of this greatness must stand forever.</span></p>

<p><span class="font15">C</span><span class="font8">ONFIDENCE between the nations of Europe no more exists. The nations, though practically bankrupt, are feverishly preparing for more war. In recent weeks an English in* 5 ventor brought forth what is designated“the 4 death ray”, a terrible instrument of destruction 1 which promises to destroy a city like London </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font8">Paris in one night, killing every person in it* । He employed an airplane to fly between London -J and Paris, negotiating with the two governments as to who should have control of this in- </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font8">vention. Even America made a bid for it; </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">but </span><span class="font8">the British Empire, by spending millions, secured it.

<p><span class="font8">During the World War some things were kejW^ ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">secret which are now coming to light. For instance, during the war, the clergy of the various churches, acting as recruiting officers, turning their church buildings into recruiting stations, induced the young men to go to war. For this service these clergymen received from the government a fixed money consideration, which was paid to them through the war office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The men who yielded to the harangues of the clergy and joined the army and marched to the front, leaving their families and loved ones behind, ■Who carried their guns and knapsacks, slept in the muddy trenches, and endured all the hardships of war, were the ones who received </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">daily allowance approximating twenty-one cents, while those clergymen who had recruited these men and who joined the armyas chaplains received about $5.00 per day, their chief duty being to dispense cigarettes to the. men and occasionally go through a formalism called a religious ceremony. These truths coming to light are not pleasing to those who have borne the burdens of the aftermath of war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8">The discontent of the people is rapidly grow- | ing. The unemployed are numbered by the mil- J lions.

<p><span class="font8">Ten years after the beginning of the World <sub>;</sub> War Europe is in a worse condition than prior to the war.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark80"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark81"></a>Reason for Menacing Situation</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE must be some good and adequate reason why Europe is in such distress and perplexity, and why this condition increases rather than decreases. The people are enjoying greater light on inventions and methods of progress than ever before; yet they are unable to solve the perplexing problems. There </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font8"> a reason for this condition, and there is but one reason. That reason was mentioned by the Lord in His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">For many centuries past the nations of the earth have been under the domination of an invisible ruling power, Satan, who has opposed God and opposed righteousness, and has resorted to* oppressive methods in controlling the peoples and nations of earth. The world powers, under the domination of this invisible ruler, the Scripture designates under the title of &quot;wild beast.&quot; The words well symbolize the disposition of the ruling factors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The men who have attempted to rule the earth have been overreached by the Adversary. The financial element, the real strength of the nations, have been wickedly selfish. The politicians have done the bidding of the commercial power. Ecclesiasticism for a time enjoyed the high privilege of representing the Lord and declaring His kingdom; but these have yielded to the baneful influence of the Wicked One, and ' joined hands with the commercial and political powers of the earth. Thus the three elements </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font8"> form what the Scripture defines as &quot;the beast.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The Lord declared ihat this order of things should end at some time certain; and the Scrip-ture shows that the beginning of that end would be in the autumn season of 1914, and that it f would be marked by a World War, followed by L - famine and pestilence. Jesus, then speaking £ specifically of conditions which would exist in £ the earth following the World War, and which would be proof conclusive of the end of the old world, said: &quot;Upon the garth distress of ? nations with perplexity: the sea and the waves £ ‘ [restless people] roaring; men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things * which are coming on the earth.”' Thus we see a [ complete fulfilment of our Lord’s word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again the prophet of the Lord, looking to this time, said: &quot;This is the day of God’s vengeance.” And then to the people the prophet says: &quot;Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, </span><span class="font8" style="font-style:italic;">ye</span><span class="font8"> people; let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations.”—Isaiah 34:1, 2.</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark82"></a><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark83"></a>Will Result In More Trouble</span></h6>
<p><span class="font15">I</span><span class="font8">T IS apparent to all thoughtful men that the present conditions of the world point to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font8">great time of trouble not far distant The statesmen of the world recognize this and free*-ly say so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Jehovah foreknew exactly what would transpire at this time and, speaking through Hia prophet and referring to this day, said: &quot;And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people; and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time; and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.”—Daniel 12:1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again-the Lord, through His prophet, said: &quot;Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.”—Zephaniah 3:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Referring to the same time Jesus said that the distress of nations and perplexity would be followed by a time of trouble such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, and that there should never be another.—Matthew 24: 21, 22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Again, God’s prophet, describing the selfishness of men, gone to seed, says: &quot;They go down to the sea [to the restless, disordered condition of humanity] in ships [great corporate powers and organizations] and do business in great waters [indulge in great commercial transactions amongst the people.] These see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep.” (Psalm 107:23, 24) Then the Lord describes the great trouble that follows and the result in these words: &quot;They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits’ end Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He . maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.”—Psalm 107: 27-30.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Remedy for Earth’s Turmoil</span></p>
<p><span class="font15">T</span><span class="font8">HERE is but one remedy for this distressing condition of humanity, and that remedy is the kingdom of the Lord. God, through His prophet, said that he would shake all nations and then the desire of all nations would come. ’Again, through the prophet Zephaniah He said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>(&lt;</sup>For then will I turn to the people a pure lan- -guage, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, to serve him with one consent.”—- ' Zephaniah 3:9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Z</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">When the peoples of earth turn their hearts and minds to the Lord He will bring them out . of their distressed condition and will establish J amongst them a government of righteousness that shall fulfil the desire of every honest heart</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark90"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark91"></a>Review of Book</span></h5>
<p><span class="font8">« ANGELS AND WOMEN” is the title of a book just off the press. It is a reproduction and revision of the novel, “Seola” which was written in 1878, and which deals^with conditions prior to the flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">Pastor Russell read this book with keen interest, and requested some of his friends to read it because of its striking ha,rmony with the Scriptural account of the sons of God described in the sixth chapter of Genesis. Those sons of God became evil, and debauched the human family prior to, and up to, the time of the great deluge. We call attention to this book because we believe it will be of interest to Bible Students, who are familiar with the machinations of the devil and the demons and with the influence exercised by them prior to the flood and also now in this evil day. The book throws light on the subject and it is believed, will aid those who carefully consider it to avoid the baneful effects of spiritism, now so prevalent in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The book </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font8">revised and published by </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a per</span><span class="font8">sonal friend of Pastor Russell, and one who </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font8">close to him in his work. It is published by the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A. B. </span><span class="font8">Abac Company, New York city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8">The publishers advise that the regular price of this book is $2:00; but to all subscribers of The Golden Age, it will be furnished at $1.00 per volume, when ordered in lots of ten or more. This is not an advertisement, but a voluntary comment.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font8"><sup>117</sup> Again the Apostle likens the ’whole of the -Christ to a living stone, saying, “Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. . . . Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious; and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious.” (1 Peter 2:5-7) In earthly buildings there is no chief cornerstone; but in this building of God there is a chief cornerstone, which is Christ Jesus. The topstone or chief cornerstone of a pyramid is itself a perfect pyramid. The other members of the body, then, must be built up into Christ to conform to that chief cornerstone, which is illustrated by the Great Pyramid in Egypt.—See Isaiah 19:19.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>818</sup>Again this anointed class, Jesus the Head and the Church His body, is spoken of as a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people. This was foreshadowed by the nation of Israel, particularly by the priesthood in connection with the house of Israel. The apostle Peter ■speaking of this class says: “Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Peter 2: 9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>81B</sup>The members of the body of Christ, the Church, are also designated as His footstep followers; and as such they are called to suffer with Him that they might also reign with Him. /For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Peter 2:21)- These are also designated as Christians. It does not mean that because one is a member of some earthly organization called a church he is a Christian or a member of the true Church.' The true Church is the body of Christ; and any one to be of the true Church must be a follower of Christ in the truest sense of the word. To this class are given the exceeding great and precious promises recorded in the Bible, the promises of being associated with Christ Jesus in His kingdom; (2 Peter 1:4)] Not to the world, but to His followers Jesus said: “Be thou faithful unto death, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">and I will </span><span class="font8">give thee a crown of life.”—Revelation 2:</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8"><sup>520</sup>No one has been able to understand </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">these </span><span class="font8">things and appreciate them except 'those </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font8">have given their hearts to the Lord. The apostle Paul says: “The natural man receiveth not </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font8">things of the spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.” (1 </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Cor</span><span class="font8">inthians 2:14) Jehovah has so arranged that only those who have their minds illuminated by the holy spirit, which follows their consecration, justification, and acceptance by the Lord, can understand and appreciate the mystery </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font8">God. These are the ones designated by ~th£ prophet Joel as the servants and handmaidens of God; and in the Gospel age God pours </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">out </span><span class="font8">His spirit upon them, which means to give then! His spirit. But in God’s due time He will pour out His spirit upon all mankind, so that all </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">can </span><span class="font8">understand His wonderful plan.—Joel 2: 28,</span></p>
