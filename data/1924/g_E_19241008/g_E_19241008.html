<p><span class="font10">Morel, member of Parliament, as saying, “Frantic preparations for war are being made all over the continent. There is going on now a more extensive output of war material than at any time since the 'peace'. The powerful industrial and professional interests of France are turning Europe into a vast arsenal/' Mr. Morel stated that the chief centers of production are in Czecho-Slovakia and Austria, where during the past two years whole trainloads of war supplies have been manufactured for Jugoslavia, Roumania, Poland, and other neighbors of Ger, many and of the Balkan States. Mr. Morel pointed out that these war munitions have been paid for by money loaned to France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">' The number of American tourists visiting Europe this year is put at 300,000. Not only is this a record toll of tourists, but their average expenditures are put at $1,000 each, which is double what it used to be. The result of this greatly increased expenditure of American money in Europe lias had the effect of materially helping the European exchange situation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">FTER almost interminable discussions Russia and Britain have finally come to an , agreement of much the same Icind that a family comes to when they have had a good, old-fashioned family row. These nations have agreed for the present to forget everything that hap, pened during the ten years from 1914 to 1924. .But the Soviet Government is ultimately to pay a lump sum which will be divided between the sufferers by its acts, after a commission has determined just what these sufferings amounted to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">p The treaty between Britain and Russia omits all mention of the king of England,- This is &gt;&nbsp;the first time that such a thing has ever been- -J done in a British treaty. The reason for this. <sup>:</sup> j is that there is no head to the Russian Govern-^,5 ment, and the treaty was made not in the name -e of any Russian individual, but in the name of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It is not expected that the king of England will sign: </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">the treaty, there having</span><span class="font10"> been some intimations t that the Soviet officials were unwilling to sign a treaty bearing the signature of a king. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">About a year ago, Philip Snowden, the pre- v sent Chancellor of the Exchequer of the British Government, moved in the House of Commons ;•/ a resolution in favor of. Socialism. But the &gt;&nbsp;newspapers report that on May 21, 1924, at a &gt;■ reception at Buckingham palace, Mrs. Philip ? Snowden appeared in a gown of soft, jade-green J crepe romain with the draperies held at the waist with a jeweled belt. Besides this, a train’ ; of silver lame shot with jade fell from her right shoulder and was held at the left side of <sup>L</sup>‘ i her waist. Moreover, she had a white ostrich feather fan, ornaments, and pearls.

Cosgrave to make the settlement of the boundary question the first business to be taken up by Parliament when it ^resumes its sittings September 30, a month pearlier -than was desired or expected before their visit to Dublin. A bill to settle the boundary question has already been introduced in the .House of Commons; but debate upon it is postponed until the end of September, in hope that meantime the Ulster Government will nominate a member of the boundary commission.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">A French invention which bids fair to reduce the dangers of automobiling at difficult crossings consists of metal plates across the roadway which, as soon as they are struck by an automobile, instantly flash lights or danger signals in front of the car itself, and also in front of any car that may be approaching the crossing from a transverse direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Paris claims to have the worst case of automobile insanity of any city in the world. At^ one of the crossings in the city the number of vehicles passing average 26,000 per hour for four hours. If anything could be better calculated to kill children and to tear to pieces the nerves of adults than these rushing, squawking, vile-smelling appendages of modern civilization, it is something quite outside the bounds of our imagination.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">G</span><span class="font10">ERMANY is lining up into monarchist and anti-monarchist organizations, all more or less military in their arrangements, the monarchists vowing the destruction of the republic and the anti-monarchists promising to defend the republic with their lives.

<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font10">T IS with a great deal of satisfaction that every normal human being reads that during the past year the same people who in 1917 and 1918 were doing everything humanly possible to starve the women and children of Germany, have been doing everything possible to counteract the effect of what was done during those days of insanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Indeed, one could almost wish that some of these good men and women had had a little of that goodness about them in 1917-1918, so that many children could have been spared the ravages of tuberculosis and rickets, now so common throughout Germany. In time of war it is fashionable to be absolutely heartless; but after it is all over, all the really decent people feel differently, and regret that they were so easily led into savagery and cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">One man, John Borton, after describing the emaciated shoulders and legs, and the dark rings under the eyes, and then the gratitude bestowed upon himself as one of the relief workers engaged in the feeding of these children who were so unnecessarily starved, said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Before describing the construction of a Radio ' Receiver, let us look at some of the causes of loss of energy, and see if there is not a way to remedy this matter;' for with a good antenna, good ground, one vacuum tube as a detector and a properly designed circuit, this alone should bring in almost all the stations one would expect to hear comfortably. The reason why the average set does not bring in the station we desire is not because the energy is not there to be picked up, but because the circuit and the instruments of the average Radio Set are of such high resistance that the feeble currents cannot fight their way through or are grounded by a poor variable condenser.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Simple Way Proves the Best</span></h5>
<div><img src="g_E_19241008_files/g_E_19241008-7.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">ET us learn the lesson, and learn it </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">well, </span><span class="font10">that a high resistance circuit is the cause of the loss of two of the most importaut factors in Radio; (1) the set not tuning sharply, and (2) the absorption of feeble currents that could otherwise be tuned in to clear audibility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now, then, is there no way to overcome this common enemy? There surely is; but'strange to say, from the layman radio-man to the large manufacturers, they all seem to take the longest way home. They invent fancy circuits that make your head swim to look at. They discuss at long lengths, radio frequency amplification. They use more tubes to make the set look better. But every tube and transformer is bound to have its nerve-racking inherent noises; and when speech or music is heard, it is almost unrecognizable due to high amplification. The more simple way often proves to be the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine that we could follow the current induced into our antenna by a distant radio station, all the way through the set and to the ground. The very first thing that could be seen is the resistance of the fine wire with which the coils in the average set are wound. But it does not slop here. More important is what the wire is wound on, and the resistance of the things that axe near the coils; still more important is the varnish or shellac with which the wire is coated, and sometimes the insulation of the wire itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A perfect coil would be wound on air and insulated with air. Such a coil, of course, is not possible to make; but we can make one pretty close to it. We regret to say that such coils are not to be bought on the market, but must be made at home. They are easily made by simply passing the wire in and out between brass pegs set into a board. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;।</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The coils should be 3^ inches in diameters Since we want a very low resistance coil, the wire used is number fourteen, double cotton covered. By all means avoid fancy wires, such as stranded or Litz wire; and when soldering use nothing but rosin. Also, as far as possible, avoid putting tape on the coils. Try to cover the wave length range with a single coil. Where this is not possible, cut in a separate loading coil, not too close to the main coils. Now we have a really good low resistance coil.</span></p>

<div><img src="g_E_19241008_files/g_E_19241008-8.png" alt="" style="width:14pt;height:17pt;">

<p><span class="font10">HE next question is * a matter of a good' condenser. This is as essential as a good coil; for it is absolutely-useless to take pains to construct a good $oil and use a poor condenser. This fact cannot be over-emphasized. There is a great deal of difference between a fairly good condenser and a correctly designed low resistance condenser. The best type is that known as the grounded rotor variable condenser, which has metal ends. The names of three of the best are; Allen D. Cardwell Condenser, General Radio Condenser, and the General Instrument Condenser. The number of really good condensers is small indeed. In mounting the condenser, always connect it so that the wire to the grid leak and grid condenser comes from the stationary plates, and the wire<sup>1 </sup>to the filament comes from the rotary plates. It is then possible to tune in signals without trouble from “hand capacity”, one of the most exasperating things in Radio. The proper capacity for the condenser to be used in the circuit described herein is .0005, which is a 23-plate variable condenser with vernier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The next piece of apparatus essential of good quality is the detector tube socket. It should, if possible, be made of porcelain; the next best is hard rubber or moulded bakelite. The two</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. amplifier sockets need not be so particular; for . they handle only audio frequencies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">‘ After all our beautiful arrangement and painstaking effort, let us not spoil the whole .. thing by cramping the works too close together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Run the leads in the air if possible; keen the ’ coils away from the condenser; and lot nothing touch the coils, except where they arc tied to the small wooden strips by waxed cord.</span></p>

<h5><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Circuit Must Be Carefully Made</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">A FTER almost two years of experimenting with new circuits, we have actually proven that the old double circuit employing an Apcro-die Primary is the best. So tins is the circuit to secondary circuit. Somewhere between 14 <sup>an&lt;</sup>^' y<sub>2</sub> inch is about right. To couple it closely will increase signal strength, but the sharpness of tuning will be lost. All coils are wound with number fourteen double cotton-covered wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The first section of the secondary should be kept at least six inches from the second section, and it is a good idea to place the variable condenser between those two coils. These ooils should be wound as tightly as possible;, for. hand-made basket coils always vary slightly in inductance, and the number of turns determines the wave length of the receiver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The model was especially designed to receive Station WBBR, and to have the peak of effi-. ciency occur at its wave length, or 273 meters. ^Without the loading coil, the set will tune from 200 to 375 meters; and with the loading coil, - will tune from 350 to 550 meters, thus affording ease of tuning over the entire band of broadcast wave lengths.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">in order to get the set to oscillate on high waves. : or while the loading coil is being used. The best method of determining whether or not your set will oscillate over the complete band of wave lengths, is to moisten the tip of the finger and keep tapping lightly the part of .the variable condenser which is connected to the grid leak. A weak click is always heard; but <sup>5 </sup>if the set is oscillating properly, a very pronounced click will be heard in the head telephones. If this oscillation click is not heard"</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">it is a sure fact that your tickler coil is reversed,</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">The tickler is a 35-turn honeycomb coil. The .. small wire in this instance is permissible because it is carrying audio frequency. The . location of the tickler is at the lower end of the second section of the secondary or farthest end away from the grid lead. This seems to be </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font10">better location, as it builds up the signals in </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">’ a </span><span class="font10">greater degree than if it were placed at the upper end of the secondary, as the convential method is. It was necessary to employ ext^cme-</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">&lt; ly </span><span class="font10">close coupling of this tickler to the secondary</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Just a word in regard to the winding of all • coils: It is very easy to make the mistake of winding one coil in one direction and the other . coil in the other. If this is done, the set will <sup>: </sup>not work. Make it a point to got the honey- 1 comb coil that you expect to use as the tickler 'iT coil, determine the direction in which the coil is wound, and wind the other coils in the same &gt;■ ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. direction. In*this way it is not possible to make the mistake and have the usual worries of won-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. dering </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font10"> it does not work.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>^Loading Coil and Short-circuiting</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">S STATED before, when designing ihis set we were more interested in having its greatest efficiency occur around 273 meters. Thus, in order to raise the wave length to stations that use higher wave lengths than the set would go, it was necessary to insert in the secondary circuit, as indicated in the Schematic Diagram, a loading coil. We concluded that a fifty-turn honeycomb coil would suffice. If greater efficiency is desired, a like coil can be wound by hand to replace this honeycomb coil. In mounting this coil, try to get it to the back of the cabinet; and it should be turned at right angles to the rest of the coils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A satisfactory switching system to cut this coil in and out has not yet been determined; for it is a bad policy to short circuit it by a switch fastened to the panel, because this is the grid lead side and also the high voltage end of the coil. So the best way at present is to cut a short piece of flexible wire about three inches long, solder a clip to one end of this wire and the other to the honeycomb coil; then when short waves are desired, simply short circuit the loading coil.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Assembling the Set</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">M</span><span class="font10">OUNT the coils in the center of the panel, and at least 2 inches away from the panel. (Do not shield the panel.) Construct three hardwood pieces by y&gt;, place the lower ones 2 inches apart, and the other at the top of coils. Tie the coils in place with waxed string. It would be still better if these pieces were first boiled in paraffin oil. The two lower pieces will afford the hinging of the tickler coil, so that coupled to the secondary it can be variable. Run the flexible leads from this coil to the plate and to the Detector jack. Also make the grid lead h’s short as possible. Use only the very best Mica condenser, the capacity .00025 and 7 to 9 megohms grid leak for UV199 tubes</span></p><img src="g_E_19241008_files/g_E_19241008-12.png" alt="" style="width:88pt;height:65pt;">

<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE above precautions apply to a two-tube set just as well as to a three-tube one To amplify signals of minute strength is quite^ difficult; . but if good transformers\ are&amp;iiied* and carefully wired, also if a “C”-Battery</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">used, it is quite possible to amplify these signals:' (if they are not too weak) to fill a room yery' comfortably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;v</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Summing up the matter, the following should be expected:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font10">1. New stations you have never heard before.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">2. Greater selectivity than the average radio set. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font10">3. Control of regeneration so that weak signals can be worked up to the point where they are almost as loud as local stations.\</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font10">It does not seem real that just by overcom-ing the resistance of an ordinary circuit such results can be obtained; but </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">you,</span><span class="font10"> as well as everyone who listens, will be astonished that ■ a simple set will do such work. A similar set. was made up for amateur work; and several amateurs in Europe were heard while the set operated in New York. It was also compared with a large set of many tubes; and the signals were brought in almost as well, but not quite so loudly, on account of great amplification of the ’ large set.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is nothing hard about building such a set. Remember to stay as close to the sug-' gestions herein given as possible. Also use a long antenna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In a later issue, an article describing thereon-struction of a three-stage resistance coupled&quot; amplifier will appear. The combination of the above and this amplifier should make the ideal radio set for both distance and pure reception.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">&lt; Paul, pleading his own case before Agrippa, almost persuaded Agrippa to be a Christian. Festus thought Paul mad. As far as both these were concerned with this Radio experience of Paul's it was merely hearsay with them; they had* only Paul's word for it. From then until the present time others have said in substance: “We have only someone else's word for it that Paul said he heard this voice; therefore, it is hearsay upon hearsay. So if Festus, who was there on the ground, doubted Paul, why should we believe?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But during this time there were others who believed with a whole heart. They were called credulous, sometimes fools. For believing such &quot;madness” they suffered every conceivable kind of punishment, from rotting in filthy prisons to adorning a cross. Today they stand vindicated, even in the eyes of those who refuse to believe in miracles. Radio has vindicated them, the “invention” of this wonderful appliance is another proof of the infallibility of God's Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Like all things, however, that come from the presence of the Lord, Satan grasps it with a desperate hand, much’ as a dro\vning man grasping for a straw.

<p><span class="font10">It seems that one of the prime movers in gaining such control is the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. It is claimed that this giant has long been buying and obtaining rights of various patents that he might secure entire control of the radio field. It is even said that so much of the funds of this giant organization has been spent for patents and in securing patent rights that the stockholders have flooded headquarters with complaints, and asking information in regard to their money</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark40"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark41"></a>Disarming the Public </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Jos.</span><span class="font13"> x </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Shires</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HROUGH the medium of The Golden Age, may we express a word relative to “Disarming the Public”, that is, the individual?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A few years ago, I had never heard nor seen anything upon the subject, save what I had written; and I must say that I have written quite a bit on the subject, to which the files of many newspapers, periodicals, and magazines will testify.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I make this personal reference to show, though advocating questions about which the public had thought or heard little, that to keep sowing the seed will raise a sentiment and, will produce good. Some of my manuscripts have <sup>!</sup>■■■*• been rejected on the grounds that they were new questions, or wild and visionary, with no hope of materialization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That body of lawyers in San Francisco the other day went down on record stating that the existence of deadly weapons did contribute to crime, and (he manufacture and sale of such should be prohibited by law. We expect to hear almost all organizations assembled in convention and all educational forces speaking out pretty soon on this question. So we expect to see all these questions wc have been advocating, at a sacrifice of time and money (my stenogra^ pher bills are heavy), bring forth fruit for good and for God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Now while we class jack and bowie knives; stilettos, knucks and poison as deadly weapons and'instruments, yet there is the revolver, the ugliest and the worst. With this we will, deal more particularly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„.<sub>v</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The law is inconsistent and weak in that it allows the manufacture, sale and existence of things which it does not allow to be carried or/ used. It is like the mother who gives the child-a tin horn, and then punishes the </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">child</span><span class="font10"> for blowing the horn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- : ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is presumed that the purpose of the courts and the law is to punish and prevent crime, promote respect for the law and obedience thereto. This being true, why do the law and courts not remove from weak and frail humanity the<sup>5</sup>' implements and agencies that produce crime?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It can be clearly demonstrated that to be armed does not protect the home, the shop or the individual on the highway. Robbers or on-einics seeking life or money are armed, usually skilled in the use of weapons, fearless, care not. for their own lives nor the lives of their victims. get the drop on them, so that it is only once in a great while that the victim succeeds in defeating them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the home one has little chance with a wideawake burglar with his search-light, while the victim is half-asleep or excited. For the home, ’’ • burglar alarms could be so arranged that one -could touch them off with one’s feet at the foot . of the bed or. by hands on the headboard or under cover. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The presence of deadly weapons, especially revolvers, will cause one to agitate and court difficulties, whereas if unarmed one would court peace. Firearms are dangerous; and one who is physically unfit for fighting or a coward will create death and destruction if armed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">When a drunk, insane, mad or infuriated person takes a gun, somebody will go down, whether it is the intended victim or not. There is a chance and hope for escape with the use of all weapons, save the revolver; but when that is brandished, somebody is going down. The tendency to possess deadly weapons is a bequest of barbarism, at the behest of mammon. There is big money in making them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There is no question, and the San Francisco Bar Association bore testimony to it, that the existence of weapons, particularly revolvers, bears a close relation to crime; that ninety percent of certain crimes have a pistol associated with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">. The existence of destructive implements, and particularly the pistol, invites and encourages crime,. accidents, and suicides. Being a quick and easy means of death, revolvers especially encourage suicide. Many a suicide would never have tried any other means. The easy access to weapons, no questions asked, invites many recruits to robbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A murder means more than that some family has been made minus one or the population reduced; that ofttimes orphans and widows, broken hearts are on both sides; that of necessity there must be a funeral, that expensive courts must be set in action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After all the evil and crime coming from the-manufacture, sale and existence of deadly weap- . ons of the unlawful type, it is safe to say that not over a thousand people are highly profiting by the manufacture of them. Retail merchants make small profits, and would sell some-* thing else were the weapons taken away. We have found that the weapons are useless and dangerous, and invite crime; that they serve no purpose save, it may be said, for officers of " the law. In England officers do ndt carry weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Therefore why should the public suffer so? Is it for the benefit and profit of weapon manufacturers?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">All the reform and educational forces, such as movies, platform speakers, preachers and publications, should go to work to build up a sentiment and throw on the light Congress should empower the President, and he should issue a proclamation calling on the citizens to come in and lay down their arms at cost, and should enforce the search and seizure act. This vast amount of precious metal should be turned over to sewing machine and watch factories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If all the valuable and precious metal tied up in these things, all the accidents, suicides, murders, hangman’s ropes, courts set in action as a result of crime produced by the existence of weapons, inmates of prisons, orphans, widows and funeral processions were arrayed before us in one great panoramic vision, we would stand amazed, and wonder why it all was. .</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark46"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark47"></a>y - ■ The War Against Vaccination</span></h4>
<p><span class="font17">F</span><span class="font10">OR several weeks during this summer, the Director of the Department of Health, Dr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">C. J. Vaux, waged an intensive campaign of vaccination in the city of Pittsburgh. During jthis &quot;campaign, indiscriminate vaccination was fcarried on at public clinics, and by means of jsquads of doctors, nurses, and health officials going from house to house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ An indication of the extent of this campaign may be seen from a statement issued by Dr. ■Vaux in the public press on August‘8, to the effect that “a survey of biological wholesale drug firms in Pittsburgh discloses that since January 1 more than 976,000 vaccine points had been sold in the city and its environments. The city had vaccinated 201,113 persons since the first of the year.” In another statement made in' the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">press of</span><span class="font10"> Tuesday, July 29, it was estimated that 568,000 persons had been vaccinated in the Pittsburgh district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With this situation existing, a number of men and women of this city who objected to vaccination planned a mass meeting in protest against the campaign; and on July 27, this mass meeting was held at the Nixon Theatre, with an attendance of about 2,000. _</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">- The meeting was addressed by several speakers, including Andrew G. Smith, Attorney and Chairman; Mr. .Harry Bonnell, scientist and naturalist, of Washington, D. C.; and Miss Lora C. W. Little, of Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">* The sense of this meeting was indicated in the passage of a resolution presented by Prof. Ezra T. Artman, of the Pittsburgh High Schools. The resolution was as follows, and was published in the Pittsburgh press on July 28:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">■* “WHEREAS, the availability of world-wide vital statistics'have proven that smallpox is not prevented by vaccination; that the true preventive of smallpox and other mass plagues are sanitation, isolation and hygienic living;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&gt; &quot;NEVERTHELESS, the Health Director of the City of Pittsburgh, by virtue of an obsolete Act of Assembly, has commanded all persons of all ages to be vaccinated under penalty of a fine and of having their .residence or place of business quarantined; and is, at the present time, officially vaccinating many thousand .persons daily without regard to the condition of health ’mt history of patient in each particular case; the order ref' the director being declared to apply as well to non</span><span class="font13">in Pennsylvania </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By Geo. R. Hinde . .</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">residents of the City of Pittsburgh who may be </span>employed in the City. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“THEREFORE, RESOLVED by people in mass meeting assembled: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(1) That the Department of Public Health of the City of Pittsburgh be urged to </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">n-nn</span><span class="font9">onnea exemption from vaccination in favor of persons who conscientiously object, and that the exemption be respected and recognized by the Board of Education and by all employers, particularly the large corporations and department stores;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(2) That the Legislature at the coming session he invoked to remove all compulsory clauses of vaccination laws, and that the opinion and pledges of candidates of the Legislature upon this question be sought in advance;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(3) That the present city administration, particularly the Department of Public Health, be urged to remove, prevent and abate the unclean and unsanitary places in the City of Pittsburgh. In calling attention to the unsanitary epidemic breeding places, the Pittsburgh press has performed a valuable public service;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;(4) That the expenditure of public funds for free vaccination clinics, whether compulsory or voluntary, appears to be an unlawful appropriation of public funds and contrary to statute, which provides only for free vaccination 'of such persons who are unable to pay for the same';</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(5) That the indiscriminate vaccination of all persons who present themselves, in blind disregard of their physical condition or physical history, is in violation of approved surgical practice and common sense, and is a serious menace to public health. Every consideration of humanity demands that this malpractice ' be discontinued at once;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“ (6) That the placing of smallpox signs by the Health Department, on homes and places of business as a * penalty for non-vaccination, is a practice without justification. It is the sense of this meeting that such signs should be posted only on places of contact and should ■ be placed on vaccinated places as well;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9"><sub>t</sub> “(7) That in absence of any affirmative instructions from the Pittsburgh Department of Health relating to hygienic living or sanitation for preservation of general health and prevention of epidemics, the Pittsburgh _ Health Club is requested to supply printed matter for ’ this purpose;</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“(8) That a committee composed of the present officers of the Pittsburgh Health Club, and such other persons as may be designated by the chairman of „ -</span><span class="font8">this </span><span class="font9">meeting, be appointed to make effective these resolutions and report progress from time to time to the Secretary of the Pittsburgh Health Club; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">&quot;(9) That these resolutions be printed and copies thereof mailed to persons requesting same and to all City and County officials, and to the heads of department stores and large corporations.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Following this, on the 29th of July, Dr. Vaux issued a reply to the anti-vaccinationists, resorting to generalities and making no defense worthy of a scientific man in respect to the task which he had assumed of vaccinating the entire population of the city. In this statement, he indicated his intention to continue the campaign, expressing the hope that ninety-five percent of the city's population would be vaccinated by autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the period of these activities, the Health Director had followed the plan of quarantining the homes of those who objected to vaccination, even though there was no contact with the disease. It is interesting to note that in the press of August 8, the Director announced *^at this practice would be abandoned, and his officials proceeded to remove the signs from the houses upon which they had been placed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again, on August 13, the orders of the Health Director were further modified by a statement in the public press to the effect that the requirements in respect to school schildren would be changed; and that for the coming term in school, children would not be required to show a certificate of vaccination made since the first of this year, as it had been stated would be required before A</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">dmi</span><span class="font10">ssion to school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The anti-vaccinationists held another meeting in the city on August 14, at which reports were read by the Secretary of the Pittsburgh Health Club, Mr. John F. Flood, of cases which had been investigated in which illness and death followed vaccination, and to which sufferers and relatives ascribed subsequent ill effects to compulsory inoculation against smallpox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">At this meeting, tentative plans were laid for carrying the fight ag</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">ains</span><span class="font10">t compulsory vaccination to the State Legislature at its next session in order to obtain such action as would either remove the compulsory feature entirely from the statute or cause the insertion of a conscience clause whereby conscientious objectors might be granted exemption from the vicious requirements of the Act as it now stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">An effort is being made by the Pittsburgh Health Club to obtain the cooperation of all persons and organizations within the State of Pennsylvania for the purpose of extending this fight against vaccination into all parts of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A ridiculous feature of the campaign of vaccination in the City of Pittsburgh is apparent in view of the fact that less than one hundred cases of smallpox appeared since the first of the year in a population of about 600,000. It seems very evident that the fear of an epidemic with such a situation prevailing would be entirely uncalled for, and the attitude of the Health Department would require some other explanation than could possibly be drawn from the facts in the case.</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark50"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark51"></a>Attorney General Stone’s Great Task</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">rTTIOR </span><span class="font10">a generation past it has been the custom ' of wealthy crooks in Wall Street, when they wished to stop some other wealthy crook from '/loing something that would hinder their own schemes, to employ private detectives to spy ;iipon the other fellow, invade his home and Ids office^ break open his desk, and steal his papers. Then, if they were so fortunate as to &quot;get something on him&quot; they would hold it as a club over ■him, to make him do as they wished. If he be' came disobedient, he was turned over to the federal authorities and sent to prison; but the real object in &quot;getting something on </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10">&quot; was not to send him to prison so much as it was to keep him docile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">During the great epoch of &quot;making the world safe for democracy&quot; this industry seems to have been transferred to the United States government and located in the Department of Justice, the advantage being that thenceforth the people would pay all the bills, while the work could be done more thoroughly, and the results would be the same. This seems toj be about the drift of the data that have come to light regarding the ■Department's Bureau of Investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">■ ■ The </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Evening Star,</span><span class="font10"> of Washington, D. C. gives the following as the testimony of Mr. John W. H. Crim, United States Assistant AttorneyGeneral, as given before the Brookhart Committee, the senatorial committee engaged in looking into this matter: He says of the Bureau (and this gives us an idea of the magnitude of the task before Attorney-General Stone in cleaning up the Department):</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“I was one of the first men ever in it. I was an agent of the department for a few months a good many years ago. I have seen it grow and develop. I think it is desirable to do away with nine-tentlis of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">“Many of the men in the bureau come from the comer drug store, absolutely inexperienced for investigation work. They were appointed because some Congressman or district political leader wanted to reward them for services in campaigns. Their employment is a men.-ace to the government. They get into the department, form alliances, and the result is a den of iniquity. The results of the bureau have not justified its existence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The American Civil Liberties Union, from which the foregoing data were obtained, also gives us the following paragraph:</span></p>
<p><span class="font9">Actual expenditures of the Bureau of Investigation for 1913—1923 and estimated expenditures for 1924— 1925, taken from the Estimates of Appropriations and the Reports of the Attorney-General, as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">How will common simple people enjoy life in heaven, such as shoe cobblers, street cleaners, wash women, scrub women, and men that have have done the dirty work to keep the ones higher up clean and comfortable, to produce the fuel and bread and materials for their fine comfortable houses to live in, and the great edifices in the institutions of learning, worked in sweatshops to produce fine clothes to make them appear refined and imposing and respectable for heaven—and who of course will scramble for the fhiest places and best advantages there T If everybody that belongs to a church and believes in going to heaven goes there, we may be sure that it is the same environment, the same routine of passing the time there as it is down here.

<p><span class="font13">What We Do </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">For</span><span class="font13"> Money </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">By John Buckley</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE love of money is the root of all evil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Yet we cannot do without it, and would not if we could. It has caused wars without number, with their attendant miseries and death. It ^brought Bolshevism to Russia, an effort of the workers to rule; and in Italy we have the Fascist!, who would stabilize by continuing the old methods. Everywhere there is condemnation of an effort to change, due to the fear that we might get something worse. Everyone hopes-that in some way luck will come to him, and that he will get money, and be able to live on Easy Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The man who would gamble puts his money into stocks. Another, \vho has a little in the bank, hopes to buy a two-flat or three-flat house, and have a less prosperous tenant help to support him. There are many theories for improvement, all of which are blocked by the many conflicting interests and by the fear of the unknown and untried. This fear will prevent any concerted effort at improvement, until war or a financial catastrophe brings universal ruin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Money as a medium of exchange we must have; and the government issues or coins it. Yet the government does not own it. When a government needs money to conduct a war, it borrows on its bond, which is practically amort-gage on the property of its citizens; and both the interest and principal are paid by taxes levied on the people. If it became necessary, the government could absorb all the money in taxes, most of which could be wasted in warfare, as a great part of the taxes now are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Capital, like labor, has an individual ownership. The government may draft the labor, as it did in the World War, and pay what wages it will. But it cannot touch capital; for that would be robbery. The government must beg for money; and offer an inducement to get it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Everyone, from the banker to the bootlegger, is afraid of paternalism in government; and, like naughty children, they believe that they should be permitted to exercise their individual liberty, refusing the guidance of reason. Should the government issue, control, and own the money of the nation, making it a punishable offense to lend money at interest, it would be taking a step in the right </span><span class="font9">direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The interest on necessary loans, which could ; be negotiated through the government, would; support the government, instead of taxes. Any; -values, either in property or in cash, should be. recognized by the government and purchased by;' an issue of low interest-bearing </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The capitalist could live from off his income while it lasted, but could not reinvest it; and the capitalist, without confiscation, would soon disappear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Every man without an occupation should be under suspicion and observation. There should . be no idlers nor loafers. All labor should be' paid for in proportion to its value to the com- ‘ munity. To be an idler should be a disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We are coming to a pass where a change is inevitable; and unless better reasoning is used than has been in the past, we may find ourselves in a like case with Germany. We, like her, are an industrial nation, dependent upon the markets of the world, though in a lesser degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Jewish law. forbade the charging of interest to a brother, and the early Christians thought the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">loaning</span><span class="font10"> of money beneath them, &quot;&nbsp;but they </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">gave</span><span class="font10"> freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">There are great changes in our day! Laborsaving machinery, which is hp^n</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font10">g a factor to force a change, is being daily and hourly perfected and improved. The automatic machine will produce from 200 to 2,000 times as much as hand labor. A simple and cheap little attachment, which is soon to be placed upon the&quot;*-market, will convert any old-fashioned machine tool into an automatic machine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ordinary laborers in many parts of the country command higher wages than skilled factory workers, store people, and clerical help. Farm labor does not last the year round; and when the farmer cannot get help, he is forced to use a tractor or other machinery. This further lessens the chances of the laborer in the country. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Most of the high wages in the cities are paid for building construction and skilled labor. / Rentals and living are high, and it would take but little to bring many people to a state of desperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Shall we read the writing upon the wall, and make a change? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_ .</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We will not! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>

<h4><a name="bookmark54"></a><span class="font13"><a name="bookmark55"></a>Wage Levels and the Tariff </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Ej </span><span class="font12" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">a. h.</span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;"> Kent</span></h4>
<p><span class="font10">jpHE wage basis of a nation is the gold value ;X of the wage paid to those who labor in production. . If a. nation were self-supporting and ^exchanged no product with other nations, there |would-be no difference whether its wage basis ^vas one, five, or ten dollars per day, providing, ^however, it was always the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The cost of a product is determined by the </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">Wage</span><span class="font10"> its producers receive. One-dollar wage would buy the same amount of product produced at a one-dollar wage, as ten would buy of the same product produced at a ten-dollar wage. ? .The trouble starts where products produced at the different wage levels compete in the same ^market A nation with a one-dollar wage basis can sell to a third country at 400 percent profit .at the same price that a nation with a five-dollar wage baris could sell at cost. It should be evident to all that this disparity in wages can not be corrected by tariffs any more than by war machines*</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Judging by the price of the mark the gold value of the wage in Germany must be very much less than that of the United States. After paying high tariffs, Germany can compete in our markets and flood them with goods at a profit to herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">f The tariffs paid, however, do not come from Germany, but are paid by her customers here, and are ultimately paid by the consumer. Even if Germany is forced to pay higher prices for her imported foods and raw material, she is buying them in the markets of the world. What we sell her is sold in competition with coolie and other cheap labor. The result is that Germany, with her indemnities, subsidies to big business, interest on her enormous debt, debased currency, lack of raw material, and other handicaps^ is busy. She works and eats while the United States with her vast resources and large bank reserves is comparatively idle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">c;&quot;It is evident that both England and Germany ■with their low wage levels have always enjoyed much advantage in the world's markets. But .to reduce our wage level to that of Europe would multiply the burdan on our debtor class :by two or three, and increase the buying power :of the wealth of our creditor class to the same ^extent, provided, however, that something -worse did not happen first. Changing wage ^levels causes rank injustice, and changing other</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">prices has the same effect. Protective tariffs, subsidies, price guarantees, and discriminative freight rates are all class legislation. Their purpose is to protect certain classes; and they do, but at the expense of all others interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A forty percent tariff on imported woolen goods enables our makers to increase the price of their product to that extent; and, if they do, that enables the importer to advance his imports to the same figure, or just enough to pay the tariff. The importer may also be a jobber in the home products. In that case he or the business association to which he belongs names a selling price for both products. That eliminates all competition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Because of the tariff, the consumer may or may not pay extra the amount of the forty percent. If he does, he is paying it on both the home products and on the imports. If he does not, it is because he would have been held up for the same prices, tariff or none. With wholesalers competition means to compete for the highest prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The purpose of a 33 percent tariff on imported wool is to raise the initial price of the home-grown product to that extent. Whether it does or not, the home manufacturer of woolen goods will be forced to pay that amount above the world's market for his raw material, giving the foreign manufacturer that advantage in the home markets and in the markets of the world. The consumer of woolen products (the same old goat) must pay the advance in higher prices for the products of the home supply as well as of the imports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The effect of higher prices is to lessen consumption and imports. For this reason it is doubtful if the revenue from tariffs will he greatly increased. Diminishing the output also diminishes the labor requirement, and this further reduces consumption. In order to reap the same profit, the home manufacturer must either speed up or reduce the price of his labor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whether the producer gets any advance in prices past the speculator is a question; but if he gets the full benefit intended, it is pldin that the public would save about one-half their increased living expense by paying that benefit in direct tax instead of tariff protection. The added cost to the public in higher living expense is from two to five times the amount of</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font10">revenue the Government receives from tariffs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We reason thus: If we import one-half of a product used, and the price is raised on all, then the increased cost is twice the tariff receipts. If we import one-fourth, it is four times the receipts. The manufacturer profits by a tariff on finished product, because it kills foteign competition below a certain level; and he loses by a tariff on raw material. The laborer and consum- • er lose by both. The protection given to industry by tariffs is limited to those that own its capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Ij is difficult to trace all the effects and counter effects of tariffs on trade. The main theory is that they so protect an industry that in time it will expand to the needs of the nation and give increased labor to its people. In effect they enable the foreign manufacturer to transplant to our soil his factory, cheap labor, and machinery, and to collect a royalty of $1.67 per hundred pounds for all sugar used, from the baby's sweet stick to the old gentleman's coated pill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">We also furnish his imported laborers with beautiful (?) building sites and spacious garden plots along the railroads' right of way, together with an abundance of such building material as car doors, goods boxes, tin cans, and Ford engine lids. This is all free; and when complete, the increased railroad valuation is properly covered by the 6 percent profit guarantee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">However, we cannot protect our foreign cousins from labor organizers by constitutional law, but we can by Daugherty injunction. We can protect almost anything that way. In 1918 society was protected from the writer's effort to sell a Protestant religious work on the Bible, while he was protected from society by the iron bars of the county jail. And the principle is not so different from protecting the people from buying their living supplies in the cheap markets of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Whatever protective tariffs may do for our dependent industries, it is evident that they further augment the trouble caused by the varying wage levels of the different nations. If the world is to continue to have open markets, then it becomes'the duty of each nation to protect its subjectsjjy establishing a just system of exchanging products.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The exporter that sells goods produced on the low-wage basis of Europe, and the importer that sells the same goods on the high-wage level</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">of the United States, can very satisfactorily arrange between themselves to look after\the4 large profits. But on the other hand, products! exported that are produced on the high-wage^ level of the United States are subject to the^ customary profit on both sides, and are contin^ ually in competition with the lowest prices the-world makes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This necessitates a very low price for raw:;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">material, and explains why our producers, of 1 initial product are forced to work so cheaply^ There seems to be only one way to correct thisj evil, and that is to standardize both labor andj product and then to exchange products accord-J ing to their labor contents and relative value, as; near a day's production for a day's production as their relative value will permit. . '</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A day's production is worth the same, whether' ; produced at a one-dollar or a five-dollar wage, ’ and can be repriced to any wage level without, changing its relative value to labor; so the na-; tions could use the labor time requirement of product as a basis for exchange.. Then eaclfna-tion could price its imports on its own labor cost basis, the same as if it produced them- This, would give an even exchange of product, no matter at what wage level it was produced. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If each nation had the same wage in gold/ and if all product was priced in gold at its.labor cost and relative value, its exchange would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">equitable. If the world would adopt that system , of pricing, gold could be earned with the same. labor the world over, and wherever it spent would buy the same product value. But until ■ the world does this, the above method of charig- ' ing goods from one price level to another could , be used without injustice to any. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It has been the duty of our Congress to see that the people were getting an even exchange. , of product with foreign countries; but they have been so busy protecting our industrialists in ;! their effort to get control of our vast resources J of mineral, oils, forests, and lands, in order that'-J these should not be left with the Government to^ be mismanaged and grafted by scoundrels who / in the future might for that purpose buy their way into Congress, that I allow they forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely there is a just and equitable way for</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font10">people to trade together; otherwise the Lord, would never have created a helpmate for Adam.</span><span class="font10">. Experience has taught that leaving the price of living supplies, which people must have, to be</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">; Why.not-establish production cost? Use the average production cost of gold as a wage basis for the different grades of labor, which should be graded according to skill, danger, exposure, veto,, then from that basis figure the production ' cost of raw wool and other things. Add the  cost of manufacturing the different grades of wool into its different products. Then for transportation cost, add a percent sufficient to cover .the standard wages of the men that produce the <sup>:</sup>raw material, build the equipment, and operate the transport systems. Then add a percent for distribution sufficient to cover the standard wages of those thus engaged. In this way establish the labor requirement of each product or service. Then use this as a base for product prices. Industry built up in this way would need no protection, save from protectionists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">If the people neglect to dictate and to institute just laws and regulations, who can they expect will do it for them? Big business? Even suppose all wayward hearts would at once turn to that of love for their fellow man; suppose the rich who own the earth with the things thereon, including certain rights to the trimmings such as Britain's rights to the sea and air, and Papacy's rights to the keys of heaven, would awake to a benevolent purpose and place their .wealth at the disposal of the people. Would our trouble be ended? No! Our questions of production, exchange, distribution, transportation, housing, equal hours of labor, equal division of the fruits of labor and of the natural products, pare still to be answered in order that their benevolence might result in equal blessings for all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">’ Really we have never accomplished much toward finding means for equal distribution of the blessings of life. Possibly we have been too . busy trying to learn how to lie, steal, and murder our fellow man without breaking the civil laws and the commandments of God. Such motives presage a vast amount of legal maze with no less a quantity of ecclesiastical misconception and misinterpretation, ail which tends to alter greatly the theory without in the least changing the fact. But it has kept us busy, and served as a smoke-screen to hide from the bright minds of earth the plain, simple truth of things really worth while.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">With the world’s experience of six thousand years in self-government, supplemented with the Bible, which emanated from the Divine Mind and is a complete treatise on individual and social law and conduct and, in part, has been in the world's possession for more than three thousand years, are our present systems the best that we can do? What can we expect will be the judgment of Christ as He proceeds to establish His kingdom in order that God’s will may be done on earth as it is in heaven? Will He decide in favor of a social order that gives mansions, diamonds, stocks, and bonds to a few or, upon a system that will give us all day by day our daily bread without our pawning for life our own energies and those of our posterity to the second and third generation?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">That tariffs protect labor or wages is a claim yet to be proven. They simply boost the selling price of imported product, or those in competition, to the amount of the tariff above what they otherwise would be, and leave industry to hire the cheapest available labor. One possible exception to this is where the industry is organized on a cooperative or profit-sharing plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">But the best cooperative plan is to divide the profits in with the wages to start with, by establishing the wages and then fixing the price of product to cover these wages, and no more. In that way every hour of labor will get its full wage, and idleness will get zero. This is a profit-sharing plan that embraces every enterprise of collective interest in the nation and every individual that contributes his labor to its well-being. It eliminates profit. It clears the way for the exclusion of its sister evil, usury, . and make*; machinery our slave and not our competitor.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">S</span><span class="font10">OME scientists claim that an electrical ring is about to break upon the Earth. If this should occur, would not a wonderful transformation take place? Doubtless the effect of electrical energy would be to purify the soil, destroy the insects, pests, parasites, and microbes that prey upon all plant life. What marvelous benefits would accrue to the vegetable and animal kingdoms! The assumption that an electrical j^ing exists, that it is closing in upon the Earth preparatory to its final contact, is borne out by a theory of Cosmogony as expressed in the Valian or Canopy Theory of Creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">According to this theory, numerous rings of water were at various periods precipitated upon the Earth, the last one to fall having caused the Noachic deluge. As a proof of the plausibility of this theory is presented the fact that the planet Saturn is surrounded by rings which have not fallen; the planet Jupiter, and its encircling belts are also used to illustrate the development of the Earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Valian Theory adheres very closely to the story of creation as recorded in the book of Genesis. Seemingly, a reasonable deduction wtfuld be that since the development of the Earth has proceeded during the past ages in a gradual and progressive way, and since the previous descent of aqueous rings has fitted the Earth more and more for human habitation, would not the remaining ring, electrical in nature, tend toward perfection of life, environment, and dwelling-place?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Surely the present wonderful discoveries along electrical lines, and the various mechanical appliances conducive to the comfort and convenience of the living generation, are suggestive of a future reveling in strange and startling potentialities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I It would not be surprising if in the very near future a method of extracting electricity from the airAVOuld be discovered, whereby mankind would be enabled to procure from nature’s great power house dynamic energy sufficient for his daily needs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Imagine oneself speeding along in an auto-/ mobile or an aeroplane equipped with ineehah^ ism capable of generating electrical energy from* the circumambient air! Suppose that all tha machinery and vehicles now being operated'by* gasoline, steam, and oil, were replaced by those; of an auto-electrical nature! Would not the danfc ger of accidents, and the inefficient operating machinery, be reduced to a minimum?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Inasmuch as the human organism might'</span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">be^ </span><span class="font10">come so energized by the influence of gentle .eleci trical currents, combined with a food supply produced from a cleansed and invigorated soil from which all pests, parasites, and germs-ot fermentation had been electrocuted, there is alstr a possibility that the consequent increase of the circulation and the purification of the blood* might be a marvelous impetus toward the'res-.-toration to humanity of mental and physical ability, and therefore to longevity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;£</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Under such influences climatic conditions on the Earth would undergo a radical change, be?* coming more temperate af the poles. Then the ice fields of the frozen regions would melt, and thus large areas of land would be released, which could become populated and productive^</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In the Golden Age, so imminent, when mani. kind has awakened from the nightmare of sin's dark night, when the “desire of all nations&quot; shall have come, and when the Lord shall have established his never-ending kingdom of peace, we* may rest assured that then all the wealth of love divine will be poured out upon the heads of the willing and obedient human sons, the ransomed of the Lord; that all the bounties of nature will be theirs to enjoy for countless ages; “The Earth hath he given to the children of ten.” “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.” “Shall he not with him also., freely give us all things?” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Marvelous indeed, will the kingdom be for? which Christians have so long waited ani-prayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•'</span></p>

<p><span class="font10"><sup>:</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men are imperfect. Judges are made of im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• perfect men. A man is no more honorable and reliable the day after he is elected as a judge ■ of a court than he was the day before. Besides, all men are influenced by circumstances; and judges are no exception, and seldom mete out true justice and righteousness to the parties involved. Concerning this we have much evidence ' relating to the highest court of the United . States. Opinions of this high court are often rendered by a divided court. The books are replete with decisions rendered in conflict with each other and in conflict with themselves. Even this high court is often charged with partiality, and that its decisions are marked with ' injustices. Predatory interests often influence it against the weak or the poor. Such is to be expected because the men composing the judges &gt;&nbsp;and counsel are selfish and imperfect, and often ■ ' unable to withstand improper influences.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font10"> World Court would be fraught with even far greater dangers.

<p><span class="font10">the people in general. A World Court, such a has been proposed, would not tend to establish peace, happiness and contentment amongst th people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">So long as men are imperfect there of neces sity would be questions of controversy arising between them, which questions ought to' be decided by some unbiased and unselfish court that would render decisions strictly in accordance with right, if such be possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">After many centuries of effort man has been unable to establish a tribunal that settles con troversal questions satisfactorily to all 0. necessity the efforts of men, who are imperfect must fail; and long experience should demonstrate clearly to the people that they should calmly and soberly look to some other source for a proper adjustment of their difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A</span><span class="font10">GAIN the people are reminded that the only</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">• solution of the perplexing problems is to turn to the Lord, who does all things righteously. Through His Word ascertain His plan, and patiently await its operation. The Bible sets forth the only solution for the perplexing problems of nations and men. In due time The World Court will be established, the judges and counsel of which will perform their duties impartially, and their decisions win be rendered according to justice and equity. Surely, then, every honest person should with eagerness desire to know how this condition is to be brought about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>r</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Again I remind my hearers that the nation of Israel was a typical nation. Its form of government was a theocracy. Its administration was intended to foreshadow the perfect government of the Messiah that is now being put in operation. One of the arms of the government of Israel, organized under the direction of the Lord, was its courts. As a lawyer Moses had no peer, because in the formation, promulgation and administration of the law he was guided by Jehovah. Among the judges of Israel were Eli, Samuel, Barak,-Gideon, Jeph-iU thah and Samson.

One peculiarity about these men and their office: They were not only judicial magistrates, who saw to it that the law was properly enforced, but they .were also the defenders and deliverers of the oppressed. The office was not hereditary, but the judges were selected by Jehovah. Nor did •these justices seek to overawe the people and ■frighten them by wearing long flowing robes or <sub>r</sub>®olsacks on their heads. Neither did they jJjSwl nor wag their head, and appear wise (while in their judicial ermine.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark64"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark65"></a>-The </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Good Judge Samuel</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">O</span><span class="font10">NE of the justices of Israel, who was made especially prominent’in the'Word of God, .&quot;whose- good deeds are marked, is Samuel. His Toother consecrated him to God before his birth. /</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">This</span><span class="font10"> is a good precedent for expectant mothers to follow. This act of consecrating the child is a an incentive to the mother to look well to the education and guidance of the youth. Samuel’s mother did that. When he was only twelve .years of age, he was committed to the custody ,and instruction of Eli and ministered in the ■temple. He became judge of Israel, and thereafter went about his circuit holding court, deciding cases in the interest of right and justice, 'and establishing contentment amongst the people. His farewell address was marked by its simplitity, frankness, sweetness, and honesty. He had dealt justly and righteously with the ’people, and they bore him witness to the truth thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">£&lt;• After long and faithful service in his high judicial office Samuel stood before the people and said: “Behold, here I am; witness against <sup>r</sup>jne before the Lord, and before his anointed: Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have oppressed? or of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?’' (How many justices of the high courts of earth could make a similar address honestly before their .constituency?)</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Samuel said to Israel that if they had any such charge to lay against him he would make Reparation. “And they said, Thou hast not de-jfcauded us, nor oppressed us, neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.&quot; (Where is Rbere another nation under the sun whose people would assemble in one great multitude and j with one voice say that much about their ’ judges?) Then Samuel said to them: ■&quot;The *. Lord is witness against you,... that ye have/ not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness/’—1 Samuel 12:3, 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It is a sad yet true fact that today the people* have lost confidence in their judges; and </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it would  </span><span class="font10">would be impossible to select a World Court that that could meet the occasion and bring the da-'-sire of the people. The mere fact, however, that' the people desire such a court and that such a -: desire is a righteous one, would warrant us in looking into God’s plan to see if He made pro- ’ vision for the establishment of such a tribunal. .</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark66"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark67"></a>The World Court Shall Come .</span></h5>
<p><span class="font10">St. Paul, enumerating some of the ablest..</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">men of the time, who served God and received His approval because of their faithfulness, mentioned Samuel, Barak, Jephthah, Gideon, Samson and David. In my last lecture here proof was submitted showing that these men, together with others who received a like approval from the Lord, will soon be resurrected with perfect bodies and serve in the capacity of the visible representatives of Christ’s kingdom on earth. In fact, these will form the visible part of the kingdom of God, for which . Christians have been praying for 1,900 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">I now assert, basing my conclusion upon the Scriptures, that from amongst these perfect men will be selected those who will compose the-nicnibers of The World Court. Concerning this the prophet Isaiah says: “I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning; afterwards thou shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city/—(Isaiah 1:26) Dr. Strong, a recognized Hebrew scholar, translates the word &quot;city? in this text from the Hebrew word which means “court'’. City is used as a symbol of an organized body created and organized for the purpose of serving the people; and here is the positive statement that these judges, when restored, shall be called the &quot;court of righteousness, the faithful court/’ That will be a, court in which the people can have confidence, and will have confidence, because the judges of that court will be guided by the invisible power of the kingdom, the Christ, in'harmony with the divine order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The kingdom of tlio Lord, as has heretofore been pointed out, is of two phases, the invisible and the visible. The invisible is (‘tilled the ‘‘new heavens&quot;, and the visible, is called the “new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness?’ The authority residing in the invisible Euler, the . Christ, the term “king’” is properly applied to ■ the Christ. The visible phase of this kingdom, as was shown in my previous lecture, will be represented by the faithful men of Israel who are called princes or-rulers in all the earth. Now referring to this new order of things, the prophet of God says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">“Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.” (Isaiah 32:1) The word “judgment&quot; here means a 3 judicial determination; that is to say, render H judgment according to truth, righteousness, and equity. If a litigant appears in that court with unclean hands he will be required to clean up before he shall ask for redress, because the Prophet, speaking of the administration of that court, says: “Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies.&quot; (Isaiah 28:17) In other words, the judicial decision of that court will be as straight as a line, and as right as a plummet, from which there is no deviation.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark68"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark69"></a>People </span><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to Rejoice in the Decisions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">I</span><span class="font10">NTO this court of justice and righteousness will the people bring their questions, confident that they will receive just and righteous .treatment No bloated corporation will influence or dominate that tribunal. No selfish profiteer will exercise any undue influence. The people will hear the decisions and be glad; because it is written: “When thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world .will learn righteousness &quot;—Isaiah 26: 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Does any sane person suppose for a moment that if a World Court, such as suggested by the Bok Peace Plan or-any other such proposition, were in forte, any government of earth would stand by indecisions under the present order if it served the selfish interest of their govern-ingfactors to repudiate the same?</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">A recent manifestation of this kind was had with reference to the League of Nations; and ‘ while in that compact it was agreed that its decision should control the nations, Italy openly defied the decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">It will not be so in The World Court under the reign of the great Messiah. Concerning that the Prophet says: “And he [the Christ] shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many. . people; and they shall beat their swords into? plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: . nation shall not lift up sword against nation, <sup>: </sup>neither shall they learn war any more.&quot;—Isaiah 2:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font7" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This is the only way that lasting peace will be established in the earth. The sooner the peoples and nations of the earth wake up to the fact that the old order is doomed, and that Christ’s kingdom of righteousness will bring their desire, the better for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people will recognize the justice and equity of the decisions of the Lord’s World Court. The rank and file of the people want to do right, if they have an opportunity; and when the greedy hand of the Oppressor is stayed, they will do right. Concerning the judgment of that tribunal the Scriptures say that “the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.&quot; ' (Psalm 19:9) “Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment.&quot; (Psalm 1:5) The Lord will see to it that the rights and liberties of the people are safeguarded, because it is written: “And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in unrighteousness.” (Psalm 9:8) And again ' he says: “The meek [that is to say, the teach-able] will he teach his way.&quot; (Psalm 25:9) That the decisions of this divine World Court will please those who love righteousness the Sriptures prove: “Judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall ’ follow it.”—Ps</span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">alm</span><span class="font10"> 94:15.</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark70"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark71"></a>Radio Will Carry World Court Decisions</span></h5>
<p><span class="font17">T</span><span class="font10">HE Lord has brought to light the great inventions of this time, amongst these the ‘ radio. With these inventions, these faithful men/as princes in the earth, ruling under the direction of the great Messiah will direct the people; then “out of Zion [the invisible part of ‘ the government] shall go forth the law, and the . word of the Lord from Jesusalem [the earthly • phase of the government].” Orders will be is- •• sued, and a judicial determination will be announced from.The World Court, and the ? radio will carry the message to the four corners of the earth. The people will rejoice because justice is done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The Lord, foreknowing the coming of this time and the blessings it would bring to mankind, caused His prophet to write: “CDhe world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth bo glad:... before the Lord; for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth.” 'With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity”—Psalm 96:10-11; 98:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">The people now are in sorrow and distress and perplexity. But let them take heart. Again I urge upon the people to acquaint themselves</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">with the teachings of the Bible. Know that the kingdom of heaven is at hand; that Satan’s empire if passing away; that soon the new heavens shall be in complete control, and the new earth, the new organized government, shall be in operation here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">This new government, including The World Court, Anil bring blessings to man far beyond his expectations or fanciful dreams of the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In November last the public press announced that 150,000 pastors of churches in the United States, and their congregations, were engaged in a drive of one whole week to induce Congress: to put the United States into, the World Court. These pastors of denominations claim to repre-j sent the Lord. They should know that-the prefixent institutions are presided over by the Devil/ The Apostle says so in </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font10"> Corinthians 4:3,4.yltn would have been far more in keeping with .the j .high office that they claim to fill for those 150,000 pastors in the United States to engage and one week’s drive to tell the people about ithe? kingdom of Messiah, and the real World Court; which shall determine the people's troubles,.ac-* cording to equity justice and righteousness, and' which will bring the desire of all honest hearts-Why do they not do it? I call upon the clergy of Greater New York now to devote some of'</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">their time to this; and since the public press is controlled by interests that do not want to publish things concerning Messiah's kingdom, I do not expect it to publish this message; but surely every Christian should want to pass it on by word of mouth, because herein lies the hope of the peoples of earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;? * -</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">In my next lecture here it will be my privilege and pleasure to point out from the Scriptures how, under this righteous government, the blessings of life, liberty and happiness will come to the people and how man will be restored.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">Z. , r ’“Any one thus presented by Jesus to the ? Father, Jehovah, justified, accepted and*begot-en, is designated in the Scriptures as a new creature. “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, JI things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17) There is now a newness of life, which does not result from being transferred to another cli-cate, but from being given a new dominating . factor in our lives, namely, the will of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">Honest Heart, or whoever takes this step, now</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">—... has new hopes, new aims, new ambitions, new aspirations, and new ideas. He is not looking ’ for earthly honor and glory; but he is looking forward to the time when he might be forever with the Lord in His kingdom and be a part of the seed of Abraham according to the promise, through which man’s blessings will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>33T</sup>This one is now dead from the standpoint of a human being, as the apostle Paul puts it: “Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ &quot;&nbsp;in God.” (Colossians 3:3) The new creature now must be renewed, refreshed and invigorated and strengthened by knowledge; not by ordinary knowledge, but by an acquaintance with , God's will and a deep appreciation of His plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">(Colossians 1:9) The world cannot know any' thing about this; only those who are in the relationship with the Lord. The whole world . lies in the wicked one. (1 John 5:19) But now ' the new creature in Christ is admonished to be , not conformed to this world, hut to be transformed by the renewing of his mind, that ho might prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.—Romans 12: 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“’The one begotten is begotten by the spirit</span></p>

<p><span class="font10">I __.into the body of Christ. lie is baptized into Christ’s death; therefore baptized into Christ’s ‘ body. To be baptized means to be immersed. :<sub>:</sub> /To be baptized into Christ’s death means to be immersed into the death of Christ. And so the Apostle puts it: “Know ye not, that so many of us as wore baptized into Jesus Christ were । &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;; baptized into his death? Therefore we are bur</span></p>
<p><span class="font10">ied with him by baptism into death; that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6: 3,4) Baptism in water is merely a symbol of the real<sup>: </sup>baptism. It would do no one any good to be: baptized in water unless he had first undergone the real baptism by being immersed into Christ</span></p>
<p><span class="font10"><sup>a</sup>”All of those who are thus inducted into the body of Christ receive the anointing through the Head of the body, Christ Jesus the beloved One. This is illustrated or pictured by God's dealings with Israel. In the type Aaron the high priest was anointed. &quot;He [Moses] poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify </span><span class="font10" style="text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font10">.” (Leviticus 8:12) This anointing oil was poured upon Aaron’s head and ran down upon his garment (Psalm 133:2) Aaron the high priest was a type of the entire Christ, Head and body. As the oil was poured upon his head and ran down to the skirt of his garments, so in antitype, Jesus the Head, at the time of His baptism in the Jordan, received the anointing of the holy spirit without measure. (Matt. </span><span class="font10" style="font-style:italic;">3:16; John3:34) At Pentecost </span><span class="font10">His disciples received the anointing of the holyspirit. And thereafter during the Gospel age all who come into Christ receive this anointing through Christ Jesus the Head by virtue of being inducted into the body of Christ <sub>;</sub></span></p>
