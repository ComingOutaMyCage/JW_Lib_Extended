<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Something about Life Insurance &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">f pulS article is not an attack upon the life J. insurance business. Life insurance is a good thing; under present conditions it is a necessity; there are circumstandes in which.to be without it, if able to provide it, would seem to be almost a crime. But we are of those who believe that death is shortly to be swallowed up of life, by the establishment of the Lord's kingdom; and hence we take a glance at life insurance as one of the businesses which, a few years hence, will be as extinct as the Dodo. This is an obituary, written in advance, so to speak. ' &quot;Vyhen Life has come, fear of Death will cease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Marine insurance has been in use since before ' the time of Christ; fire insurance also reaches far back into the past; but life insurance is but three and a half centuries old, the first policy having been written in London in 1583. It was ? of slow growth for two hundred years, so much so-, in fact, that it is estimated that at the beginning of the nineteenth century there were but . about one hundred policies in force on the whole &lt;&nbsp;\ American continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The real beginning of life insurance in America on a large scale came with the formation of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York in 1843. Today the total amount of insurance in force in the 260 companies doing business in the United States is twice the amount of * the national debt, and leads all other forms of business and investment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Life insurance has been growing prodigiously of late. Within the past ten years it has doubled in volume. In 1922 the incomes of the insurance - companies were more than double the amounts paid to policyholders, so that those who are engaged in the business are not in any immediate danger of going to the poorhouse. The year 1923 was a boom year in new insurance risks; for all records for new business were shattered by an increase of seventeen percent over the previous high year of 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The business is as safe as any business can-; be. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Half</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the population of the country are- 1 ^directly interested in it; ten percent of the assets of the companies are invested in Govern-Ufent securities; several of the companies are ? in the billion-dollar class; and their actuaries ? can tell to an almost absolute certainty, out of ; each one thousand of their policyholders, howj; many will die each year. , &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The age when there is therleast chance ofj dying is from twenty-five to twenty-eight. The<sup>1</sup> ’ vital powers idowly increase from childhood up • to that point, and then slowly give way from. that point onwards At ninety-six, according tcj ’ insurance calculators;- the policyholder is dead anyway, no matter how long he may actually •' live after that age is. reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Census Bureau shows that in the decade from 1910 to 1920 the amount of insurance in <sub>: </sub>force increased eight times faster than the population. It also reveals the interesting fact that the crowded cities of the East have lower death.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">rates than have the Western cities. New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were well below the average in the number of deaths per thousand;</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HERE are said to be 134 forms of insurance' in-general use, and some of the insurance j companies will take a chance on any kind- of risk. Those commonly known are life, fire, . marine, accident, health, plate glass, tornado, ' hail, riot, and weather. But statesmen have insured against assassination, parents against loss of their children by kidnapping, fathers have insured against twins coining to the house, students against failure to pass examinations, young men against getting married, married men against laying violent hands on their mothers-in-law, pianists against injury to their hands, singers against injury to their voices, _ violinists against injury to their bow hands, beauty specialists against injury to their hair. One man insured a trick baboon; and another insured against delivery of coffins at the wrong house at night, thus causing fright and possible</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The National Civic Federation is skeptical as to the value of any health insurance scheme yet ’</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">worked out, saying that &quot;from a- study, of foreign experience, and of projects and proposals -in America today, this committee is of-the opin- <sup>r </sup>ion that no plan has yet been devised for efficiently and economically providing, medical attention, hospital care and other features of&quot; health conservation, as a benefit of insurance in. conjunction with a eash insurance benefit during short sickness.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Some of the accident insurance oompanies (wa-speak from experience) contain so many exceptions as to the kind of accidents for which they pay nothing that the money sent to them is about as good to the sender as if thrown down the sewer. Such companies, apparently run not for the insured but “for revenue only &quot;. deserve little consideration at the hands of anybody tryingto tell the truth about insurance.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">BOUT every twenty years there is a great <sup>k</sup> flareup in the insurance world, a series<sup>1</sup> of investigations in which ths same old things are ' brought to light; and then everything, settles ; back where it was before. Charles E. Hughes, the present Secretary of State, made his reputation in one of these investigations, in 1906. The Mutual was in the frying-pan then. &lt;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">There was another in 1921. This time it was the Prudential, Newark’s -billion-dollar com- -pany. The President was accused of putting the policyholders’ money into his own private bank and there making a large profit on it, besides the profit included in his annual salary of $75,000. It was found that the company had a self-perpetuating board of directors, the same being about as soft a thing for the directors as one could imagine. It was brought out that although a law was passed in 1906 requiring in- -surance companies to sell their bank stock; yet' in this case the law had not been obeyed up to fifteen years later, although it has been obeyed since. The lack of mutuality in a &quot;mutual” com-, pany was brought out by the fact that in six years only one policyholder out of 15,000,000 had attended a policyholders' meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Insurance companies have about twenty-five' ^percent of their, holdings invested in transportation facilities and constitute the greatest</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">single capitalizer of industry, besides being Targe loaners to the national, state and city . governments, by the purchase of their securities. In Halifax, Nova Scotia, the banks are accused of virtually compelling their patrons to fall in line with whatever insurance company they chance to be most interested in; this is on the complaint of R J. Wickham, President of the Canadian Federation of Insurance Agents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the principal sources of profit in the* insurance business is the lapse, or canceled policy. A man. finds that he can no longer afford to carry as much insurance as he is carrying, or cannot carry any at all, and, with some exceptions, loses virtually all he has paid. In 1913 there was in New York state twice as much insurance lapsed as was paid out to the policyholders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">' New York has one company, the Postal Life, which has-no agents. The company has 27,000 policyholders, who have advertised the business</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">, among their own friends. The Postal is said to ’ sell insurance at seventeen and one-half percent less-than do the other insurance companies generally in the field, and to have as some of its policyholders the agents of other companies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Grmip Insurance</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UROPEANS love to cooperate and thus to save money; but cooperation spreads slowly in America. In Britain there are nearly two and one^uarter million people in the great Rochdale cooperative societies. A penny out of every pound sterling expended for supplies goes toward the insurance of the purchaser arid, if he is married, toward the insurance of his wife as well Automatically, the more he spends the more his insurance grows. The plan works, and works well</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Of late Group Insurance, which is a form of cooperation in insurance, has become remarkably developed in the United States. All the? actors, actresses, and theatre employes of at least two of the greatest theatrical organizations are included in a policy which insures them all, without cost to the insured, and without physical examination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It frequently happens now that copartnerships carry insurance so that in case of the death of one of the partners the business may not be interrupted by the withdrawal of capital Two railroad companies, the Erie and the Dela</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ware and. Hudson, have insured on the group plan all who have been with them more than two years. The Pullman Company has also effected group insurance for its 33,000 employes, men and women, without cost to the workers. The Southern Pacific Company has a policy' covering the 90,000 employes of that great system. The United States Steel Corporation has its own insurance fund; it charges itself only seventy percent of the usual premiums, has paid all its losses, and has save4 $30,000,000 besides. The total number of employes covered by group insurance at this time is said to be about 2,000,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the city of London the newspapers have used insurance of readers as a means of increasing the circulation, with remarkable and not always happifying results; In one case a dividend of 5,000 percent was declared byjthe insurers. Millions of pounds sterling were collected from the very poor; and when the policies were declared illegal, the money was kept instead of being returned. London financiers seem to have as little principle as have New York financiers. _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . , .

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">v V trial accidents in all parts of the United . States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico. Sixteen of the states have followed the example' first set by Norway, and. have established their own accident funds; while in Ohio, where exclusively state funds are used for this purpose, it is calculated that at least $15,000,000 per year have been saved to the insuring employers. State insurance funds show an administrative expense of about seven and one-half percent as against thirty-seven and one-half percent in states where private companies operate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Immediately the United States Government, ’ with all its vast resources, wanted to establish its own accident insurance fund for its own employes, the so-called United States Chamber of Commerce passed resolutions opposing the idea, on the ground that the United States had no right to engage in business of any kind, but must always hire financiers at a high price to do the business for them. Wonder if the United States Chamber of Commerce uses postage stamps, and how it gets them! Wonder if it has ever seen a mail wagon in .the streetl The</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. idea that only '“financiers* have the right to do anything is rich. ’ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' <sup>:</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In explaining the effort that has been made in<sup>: </sup>New York state to prevent the establishment of: an exclusive state fund for workmen's compensation, Samuel Untermeyer, the great lawyer, said:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Many false and misleading statement! have been made by representatives and officials of inaurance com-panics to. daatroy the confidence ef, the public in the State Insurance Fund. It hardly seems possible that in., this country such downright thievery as we have found could exist in the insurance business, but it does.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The American Federation of Labor has demanded slate monopoly of workmen's compensation insurance as a national policy. One reason for this is the excessive difference in cost between private company rates and state rates. In Minnesota an attempt has been made to cause the insurance companies te disgorge part of the overcharge. It is claimed that the history of private companies shows that sixty-five percent &quot;of the insurance money remains with the companies and that only thirty-five percent reaches the unfortunate workmen. The National Association of Credit Men has been warned in fearsome tones by one- of its lecturers that any attempt on the part of a state to engage-in the insurance business &quot;is the most dangerous and insidious of all socialistic movements.” Growling because somebody looks at his bone. A few such' speeches will turn everybody into- Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Unemployment Insurance ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;....</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE mentioned the Wisconsin unemployment insurance law. We mention it again. The Huber Bill, as it is called, provides that all employers in the state form themselves, into a state-wide mutual insurance company and- <sup>: </sup>pay premiums in proportion to the regularity' with which they keep their force working. The- • unemployed are entitled to benefits for six<sup>T</sup> . weeks, at the rate of one dollar per day for mem] and fifty cents a day for boys and girls unde£ eighteen. Those on strike or locked out are nbf' included in the insurance arrangement. Wiscon-*’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">sin has its own state-owned and state-managed life insurance company. Massachusetts also ha» one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Queensland, Australia, has its own state-owned and state-managed insurance company; All kinds of insurance business, fire, life, marine and accident, is transacted by the company, which is now in its seventh year. Bolivia haw enactments requiring the postal telegraph employes to deposit five percent of their earnings in savings banks, where it becomes an insurance fund against old age. Deposits may be withdrawn only in case of resignation or illness, in which latter case the consent of superior officers must be obtained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Supreme Court has ruled that life insurance is not interstate commerce and therefore is not subject to federal control, but both President Cleveland and President Roosevelt urged such, control. As matters now stand, the insure ance companies duplicate and multiply selling expense, some of which could surely be cor- ■ reeled. Moreover, by federal control it would -not be necessary or expedient for the insurance, companies to spend such vast sums lobbying- as . they now do. Or, at least, if they did spend it^ it would be all in one place, ready for investigation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Broadcast from WATCHTOWER WBBB oa a waro leogtli of 273 metora, by the Bdltor)</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">F</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OB some time there has been agitation before Congress to increase the salary of postal clerks. It has been pointed out that if this bill passes it will take in the neighborhood of $130,000,000 annually, to meet the increase. The Postmaster General has stated that this . increase will have to come from the second, third, and fourth classes of mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">iiThis statement has aroused 'publishers, who claim that the rate is already so high that the larger publications have more than half of their output sent independently of the mail; and that if there is another raise, it will compel them to organize more extensive machinery for their own distribution, taking their publications out of the. hands of the mail altogether. The pub. lishers point out that the figures of supply and demand make it necessary to pay increases to get the right kind of men, but that these same figures also show an over-supply of men; for , other avenues of employment in local eommuni-ties, do not pay so well as the postal service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Here is a good example of the tug of war that continually goes on between those who desire - more pay and those who have to foot the bill. We do not doubt that the postal employes would be benefited by a raise in salary, and that the . efficiency of the mail service would also be in. creased. The bill calls for a horizontal raise, but the United States Chamber of Commerce has suggested that the postal employes should be allowed a temporary salary supplement on a sliding scale, adjusted to the needs of the employes in their respective localities until there - can be a readjustment of wages to meet the prevailing conditions. We would like to see some such sliding scale of wages applied to the members of Mr. Morgan’s Chamber of Commeroe itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HEBE seems to be no end to the Teapot Dome and other investigations of public officials. Some of the witnesses refuse to testify, and impeachment proceedings are under way. Some claim that these inquiries into the acts of prominent men are being overdone; that they are prompted by political cunning, which is trying to put both the old parties into disrepute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But while the leaders of the major parties are 'disturbed, there seems to be no let-up in the activities. What is called by some a “political bogey” has appeared in the possibility of a third party movement Senator Shipstead refers to the political agitation as having a parallel in the days of the candidacy of Abraham Lincoln, when the Republican party came on the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Farmer-Labor party of Minnesota at a recent conference amalgamated and unified its interests for united action in the coming cam- ' paign. .The farmer, labor and other progressive forces of the State are being brought under the banner of a single standard, Since this conference the Nonpartisan League has by almost unanimous vote affiliated with the FarmerLabor party and has resolved itself out of existence. Sympathetic interests throughout the entire Northwest are expected to affiliate with this movement and to bring to a head a formidable third party movementwhich is expected to meet in convention sometime between the conventions held by the old parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The irregularities of the Teapot Dome lease were aired over two years ago in-progressive and independent journals like The (Natiow. But . the greatest news-gathering agency in the world, the Associated Press, aa late as last November threw a damper on the escaping steam and endeavored to lull the public to sleep by referring-lightly and humorously to the leaking information, as though it were nothing unusual and hardly worthy of notjce. Mr. Geddes has resigned as chief of the Washington staff of the Associated Press and has accepted,a position where he can serve the Sinclair oil interests more openly, as their chief publicity agent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As a result of the recent disclosures at Washington as to where campaign funds come from, and that some individuals contribute heavily to both parties, several bills are now before Congress for the regulation of contributions. One of these restricts individual contributions in national campaigns to $500 for presidential electors and to $100 in the election of members of Congress, and limits these contributions to one party and to one candidate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

Auctioneers in New York, employed eighteen days as ordinary auctioneers, sandbagged Uncle Sam to the tune of $50^110-08 at one time, and $167,747.18 for four days' services at another time. A Louisville firm, for one day's labor, which it is said could have been done by any derk in the war department, was paid $244-94.80. In addition to these, many ordinary auctioneers who had conscientious scruples and endeavored to be honest, received $1,000 and up a day for such services.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">During the war the meat packers were contracted with by the Government to produce a specially cured bacon for the army. The packers turned out great quantities of this army bacon. When the armistice was signed and everybody knew. that the war was at an end, the meat packers, not having been officially notified by the Government that the war had ended and that no more army bacon would be needed, con’ tinned the curing of the army bacon; and of course in dne time wanted their money for the army bacon, that was made for the army after ■ the services of the army had terminated. These </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i <sub>t</sub></span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> MDs were evidently turned down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">\ Swift &amp;&nbsp;Company sued the Government for $1,000,000, which suit was a test suit The Gov. ernment lost, and therefore Unde Sam must pay millions of dollars to the packing interests because of an “oversight” The decision is a precedent for similar claims which will be made by other packers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Frank A. Vanderlip, chairman of the Citizens ' Federal Research Bureau, which he organized, declares that he will resign as director from many of the organizations in which he has financial interests.

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">One remark in Mr. Vanderlip's letter to his critics shows the cleavage now manifesting itself between those who are public-spirited and those who are rolling in predatory wealth. He said:</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Brotherhoods’ letter, it is pointed out' that there is a rapid increase in the number of &lt;&nbsp;faecfdents because of defective equipment, especially of locomotives. In 1922 there were 622 accidents; in 1923 there were 1,348 accidents— an increase of 117 percent.

Explosions in three places have already cost more than 200 lives in 1924.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Experience has proved that the best depth to lay a submarine cable is about two miles below the surface, where it will be subjected to a uniform temperature and be free from tidal or current movements such as otherwise would soon wear it out The United States Government is about to lay a cable from Seattle to Seward, Alaska, and has two wars laps engaged in surveying the route where the cable will be laid.

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">INNIPEG is stirred by the death of a five-months-old infant. The parents had been farmers. In 1922 they sold their farm, and after a year or two moved into Winnipeg with $700 to show for their eighteen years’ work on the farm. However, there were seven children, the $700 were soon spent, the father could not get work in the city, and was obliged to seek work as a farm laborer at a distance. It is terribly cold in Winnipeg in the winter. The family lived in two rooms, without heat, and with scant covers for their beds. As they could not pay their electric light bill, the service was discontinued; and one utterly cold night, with not a ray of light in the room, the under-nourished mother felt her baby -grow cold. She ran to the neighbors for help. They came in and found that the baby was dead. The time to be considerate of the poor is before such things happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mexico</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TN THE New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> of April 1st, Dr. J- Frank Bohn says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">‘‘There are now a half million Mexicans in the state of* Texas. Fifty-five percent of the people </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> San Antonio, the largest city in Texas, are Mexkoa There is one county in. Texas where three Americans vote the straight Republican ticket, and over 1,800 Mexicans are voted straight Democratic by their American boas.&quot;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Bohn goes on to show that in 1920 there were 1,000,000 Mexicans on this side of the Bio Grande, that by now the number is probably half a million more, and that Mexican laborer* are gradually but steadily driving out all other outdoor laborer* in the Southwest He say* furthers</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Nemesis has come to judgment The despised American Indian is returning to claim, through the economic power of cheap labor, the toiler's share in 500,000 square miles of territory under the stars and stripes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports from Mexico City are to the effect that 1,500,000 acres .of land in Mexico which formerly belonged to the people as a whole, and which were subsequently taken from them by the acts of crooked ecclesiastical politicians and others, have been redistributed to the people te whose ancestors they originally belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. Bohn points out the interesting fact that at the time Mexico City was captured by the Spanish murderer Cortez, more people assembled regularly in its market-place than then lived in any city in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is said that 400 Mexican laborers who were imported into the Minnesota beet-sugar fields by the Minnesota sugar corporations have been supported the past winter by the charitable people of St PauL It seems too bad that these poor Mexicans were not paid enough for their work during the five months of the sugar-beet season so that they could live through the winter. We can hardly believe that it is necessary to raise the price of sugar in order to give these workers enough to live on. These poor Mexicans have gone through a hard winter housed in primitive shanties, devoid of every comfort. Do we want to raise sugar in the United States if we have to do it on such a basis as this?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> reports that a large company in Montana has made a request through the Mexican Consul for Mexican laborers, promising equal treatment with American labor. Does this mean that American labor is ultimately booked for the same experiences as came to these Mexican laborers in the sugarbeet fields of Minnesota?</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cuba</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O ALL intents and purposes the administration of the affairs of Cuba is in the hands of the National City Bank of New York and the Royal Bank of Canada. These two institutions, between them, operate eighty-six banks in Cuba and have seventy percent of the deposits in the island, as against thirty percent held by Cuban banks. These banks control the railroads of Cuba and seventy-seven percent of the sugar production. Every family in the United States is interested in the price of Cuban sugar, because Cuba is the greatest sugar producer in the world. The price the Cubans get for their crop determines what the American housewife pays.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Colombians indignantly deny any irregularities, although they acknowledge that Blair &amp;&nbsp;Company of New York loaned Colombia $5,000,000 prior to the ratification of the treaty, and it seems that Mr. Doheny is a-partner in Blair &amp;&nbsp;Company. This is the same Mr. Doheny</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It will be remembered that Mr. Doheny loaned this money to Mr. Fall, not to influence Mr. Fall to let the Doheny oil interests take over the United States naval reserves oil in California, . but merely because Mr. Fall was ah old friend. We do not know whether the Government: of Colombia is an old friend of Blair </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">8b</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Company or not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is also pointed out that the Tropical Oih Company, operating in Colombia, is a subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company; and that the-pipe line now in use at Colombia was negotiated; by Mr. James W.

French Guiana is a penal colony in </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">l </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the tropics, where a white man can hardly live </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">j </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">at all, where practically no food that a white man can eat can be raised, where the bread quickly gets full of worms and ants, and where . the body becomes infected_with little creatures that breed so rapidly as to destroy the flesh and to render amputation necessary. It would not be possible to exaggerate the horrors of the French penal colony in French Guiana. If the half is true, it is enough to make the heart sick to think that any people supposed to be civil- ■ ized, to say nothing of being Christianized, would consent to the perpetuation of such horrors from generation to generation. Several Germans have recently been sentenced to this hell-hole.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">OBTY-FIVE years ago in a war between 'Chile and Peru Chile seized the two most profitable provinces of Peru£hamely, Tacna and Arica. The reason why these provinces were-seized was that they contained rich nitrate' deposits, which since that time have yielded Chile a revenue of about $2,000,000,000. Naturally, Peru wishes these provinces returned; and naturally, Chile does not wish to give them up. The provinces have been held so long by Chile that the population has become mostly Chilean and very little Peruvian. The dispute has been referred to President Coolidge for arbitration.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">the policy of passive resistance to British, rale, has become an apostle of quite a different movement. As a result of his agitations Gandhi was in prison* where hg became ill with appendicitis. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> British physician rushed, him to a hospital, performed a difficult operation by the light of a hurricane lantern, and saved' his life. A strong friendship grew np between Gandhi and the doctor, and meantime Gandhi was given his • liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As a result, the traditional friendship of the Hindu for the British is being restored. But the caste system, which has been the curse of India in all ages, has been dealt quite a blow; for Gandhi is one of the common people, one of the lower castes. No doubt the Lord is back of this whole circumstance, gradually lifting np the Hindu people to a point where full citizen-/ ship privileges will be given to them. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">China &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE holding up of a railroad train is always an expensive job for somebody. The bills have just been presented for the hold-up of a train in China a year ago. The bills for lost baggage-, medical attention, loss of liberty, and mental anguish amount to over $350,000, all of * which must be made good by the Chinese people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">=■ Japan &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE New York Telegram contains a despatch from Washington which states that the chief legal adviser to the Air Service Claims Board has been suspended by the War Department, and deprived of records which reveal overpayments to aircraft concerns totaling tons of mfl-lions of dollars. This gentleman, Air. Thomas F. Lane of Missouri, claims that Japan has _ been furnished blueprints, - specifications, and patterns embodying all that America has learned in the manufacture of airplanes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Despatches from Tokio report having received clearly a speech made in Esperanto by James Denson Sayers, a contributor to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">The Golden Age,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> broadcast from Newark, New Jersey. The speech was broadcast from Newark at 6:15 P. M. and received at Tokio at 8:15 A. M., only a second afterward. This is one of the best long-distance broadcasting records yet made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The number of Japanese now in the United States is set at 130,625. This is only a little</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">more than one-tentfr </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">at</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> one percent of the totalpopulation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In a letter to Secretary Hughes dated April 10th, the Japanese ambassador to America called attention to the &quot;gentlemen’s agreement&quot; between America and Japan by which Japanese coolies are excluded from America, _and in his letter of protest made the statement that if the bill then pending in Congress providing for the absolute exclusion of the Japanese was passed it would result in “grave consequences.&quot; The.’ House of Representatives passed the bill; and the. Senate, thoroughly angered by what it re» garded as a Japanese fhreat, also passed the bill by a vote of 76 to 2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It was pointed out in the Senate that Japan exercises the right of excluding Koreans* Chi». nese, and Hindus; and-that all nations exercise the right of controlling immigration, without ■ asking the consent or permission, of other nations. One of the Senators stated that he voted far the exclusion of the Japanese with deep regret, but felt that the Ambassador’s letter, had made it necessary. This apparently, was the feeling-of practically the whole Senate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Hanihara, the Japanese Ambassador, has protested that when he used the expression -“grave consequences&quot; he had not the remotest intention of conveying a threat, but was merely pointing out how difficult it would be for the Japanese people to understand the American attitude if the bill in question became a law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Federal Council of Churches has written letters to every Senator and Representative, pressing hard for the recognition in some manner of the “gentlemen’s agreement,&quot; purposely excluded from the new immigration law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Incidentally, the same bill which excludes the Japanese altogether also </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">limi</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ts the admissable. immigrants after July 1,1927, to 150,000 a year. Meantime, on the basis of the 1890 census, there may be admitted during the next three years two percent of the foreign-born residents of the ' United States as determined by the census of that year. This will practically exclude all immigration from Southern- and Eastern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Malaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ALAYA is the new name for what used to be called the Straits Settlements, and which have Singapore as their metropolis.. From Singapore we get the interesting infor- •</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">mation that Mr. Robert Dollar, the famous shipowner of San Francisco, has started a line of * steamers which will provide passenger service around the world at fortnightly intervals. The route is from New York through the Panama Canal to Tokio, Nagasaki, Shanghai, Hongkong, Singapore, Colombo, Alexandria, Naples, Genoa, Marseilles, and thence back to New York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mr. Dollar is eighty years of age. Besides a great fleet of 100 ocean-going steamers, he con-itrols the water transportation in a district of China where 75,000,000 people have no communication with the outside world, except by steamers of his line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">South Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> TERRIBLE famine is prevailing in the central part of South Africa, due to drouth „ and the consequent entire failure of grazing - for cattle. Money-lenders in the district are reported as renewing loans at rates of interest running from 170 to 300 percent Farmers are killing their cattle to get the two dollars which they receive for the skins; and others are returning spans of oxen bought from the speculators and throwing in another span of their own, in order to pay only one-half the cost of the span originally bought and returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Australia</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE cotton-growing industry in Australia is making rapid strides, the value of the annual crop being now in the neighborhood of $4,000,000. During the past fqur years the acreage in cotton has increased eightfold. It is claimed that Australia has 15,000,000 acres that could, if necessary, be devoted to the production / of cotton. It is evident that from now henceforth the American cotton growers will find the Australian cotton fields an important factor with which they will have to contend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">On April 12th, just'outside of Sydney harbor with a very impressive ceremony, the battle cruiser &quot;Australia” was sunk in accordance with the terms of the Washington treaty. When the desired spot was reached, officers and men were lined up in their white suits on the decks, the seacocks were opened, a bomb was exploded in the hold, the men were taken </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">off,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> and straightway the vessel began to sink. In twenty-one minutes the ship turned turtle and disappeared. As it passed beneath the waves an aeroplane dropped a wreath on the place where it sank.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Bwoax.n, M. X.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scriptures say that in the age now at hand: &quot;They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn war tfny more.’*- We are witnessing the beginning of these things now. The great Krupp works are making agricultural implements; and some, at least, of the monsters of the deep are being juried beneath the wavek Sydney is to have the largest single-arch bridge in the world. This bridge, which will cost $25,000,000 and which will take six years to construct, will have a single arch of 1,650 feet span. The Quebec Bridge over St. Lawrence river has a span of 1,800 feet, the Firth of Forth Bridge in Scotland has a span of 1,700 feet; but neither of these is a single-arch span. The Williamsburgh Bridge in New York city has a span of 1,600 feet The Sydney bridge will be 170 feet above high water and will carry four railroad tracks, besides roadways and footways. Until it is completed, the Hell Gate Bridge in New York city will continue to be ] the largest single-arch bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. The same article in the New York </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> that tells us about Sydney’s great bridge also tells I us of other huge bridges that are under way. ’ One is to connect Philadelphia and Camden at an expense of $13,355,000; another is to connect* New York and Jersey City, at an expense of $17,250,000; another is to cross the Detroit river at Detroit; and another the Golden Gate at San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge will be a combination of cantilever and suspension bridge, with a middle span of 4,000 feet, more than double the length of the greatest span yet constructed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The ex-Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. William M. Hughes, is in America. Mr. Hughes is profoundly impressed with the conviction that America and Australia must cooperate to keep out the Japanese. Apparently he sees no solution of Japan’s own problem, except that the Japanese themselves must find some way to restrict the tremendous annual increase of their population. From what we can judge of Japanese history, it seems doubtful whether such a plan for restricting their national development can be made effective. It seems to us more likely that Japan will have recourse to armsj probably with unexpected suddenness. It might occur even this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;">Reports from Foreign Correspondents</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">FROM CANADA</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">N</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ATTQN</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ATX</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Y and provincially, Canada is . making a dramatic attempt at houseclean-Jng. At Ottawa, after some years of peaceful plenty, the axe is presumably about to faH, either as a result of an honest desire to reduce the Government’s expenses or for political reasons. As one reviews the portentous announcements issuing from the council chamber, one cannot help wondering just how long the present government has to live or how much of the taxparing attempt is propaganda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Naturally, the first to feel the edge of the axe are the workers, postal employes and office men especially. As far as can be ascertained, the general run of the men who will be &quot;fired” or whose income will be reduced are even now only struggling along on low wages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We are hopefully waiting for the announcement that Pr</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">emi</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">er King has discovered that he can get along on </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">half</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> his&quot; present salary, and ..that the Senators and Cabinet Ministers also feel that they would like to share in the general reductions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It is amusing to contemplate a government system that needs double the cabinet ministers apd senators to handle the affairs of eight millions of people as our neighbors across the line need to handle the business of nearly fifteen times that number. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In Ontario, a bright, snappy investigation is under way of the doings, deeds, and misdeeds of the members who occupied the Treasury benches in the lately defunct Fanner government Again, it is difficult to see through the. smoke and determine how much is political capital and how much honest zeal for the cause of righteousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Home Bank failure, succession duty-free bond issues, and manipulation of public funds for private gain are all mixed up together. As small a nation as we are, we do not intend any Yankee Teapot Dome scandal to hold all the public attention; but we will endeavor to match that evidence of mismanagement and worse with a generous airing of our own political garbage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Incidentally, the Ontario “wets” are in joyful hope of getting liquor back -again, if dear Brother “Fergy,” the present incumbent at Queen’s Park, sees in it good political material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Your correspondent’s personal guess is, “Booze before Christmas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">An interesting experiment, for it has all the earmarks of such, has been tried recently in Toronto. As reported in the Toronto </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Telegram, it</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> seems that two young gen</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">tleman</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> in holy orders undertook to tell the truth about war and a Christian’s part in it, before a committee composed of local divines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">To seasoned campaigners in the “war against war,” and especially to those who suffered bonds, imprisonment, torture, and abuse for the principle of peace, this belated attempt to stand for righteousness seems to lack spirit; but one cannot help a fellow feeling of sympathy for the attempt and a hope that it will really resplt in good fruitage. To quote: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' “Two young undergraduates from University College, R. V. Ferguson and W. S. McKay, came before the Toronto General Ministerial Association to expound the view* of the *No More War* group at the University. Mr. Ferguson, who is said to have spent four and* one* half yean with the Scot* Guard* in the war, declared that he had yet to meet the man who wenC intO the war for the principle of the things [Hear, hear; *o have we!] Some went in, like himself, for adventure; other* enlisted when they wen drunk, he declared. He accused the churche* and the minister* &lt;if being recruiting station* and recruiting sergeant*. T served four and a half year*,’ said he, ‘and I’ll never be at another war. It is the most awful thing Thave ever experienced.’ He pictured the sickening stench, the men hanging in agony on the barbed wire until a friendly spit of fire swallowed them up </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">like</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> a fly in </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a’</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> candle. *We would sing “Onward, Christian Soldier*,” and then fill ourselves up with rum so that we could do the dirty work. Thousand* of young men. enlisted in a state of drunkenness; other* enlisted to be seen in uniform; other* were lured by propaganda. The pulpit became a recruiting station. The church became a part of the organized sin. The minister* were recruiting sergeant* and the cathedrals were hung with banners.’” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Eight Christian gentlemen, including the executives, editors, and other prominent members of the International Bible Students Association, went to jail for a life sentence for saying less than that in 1918. Scores of members of the organization went to jail, were mistreated, tortured, robbed, for refusing to per* vert their consciences, to forswear themselves, and to twist and turn the-Bible teaching about war, while the war was going on. Notice the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MX &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">comments of some ministers present at this . Toronto gathering:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Bev. W. B. Caswell of Simpson Avenue Methodist Church told the speaker he was unnecessarily irritating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">*1 believe in peace/ he said, &quot;but I am not a pacifist and never will be except in times of peace. I caxft agree</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">that our men went into the war in drunkenness and as a result &lt;rf flag-waving patriotism? ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Mi. Caswell admitted that he was never in. the army, nor had he been able to serve overseas. We suggest a careful reading of his argument, and offer a prize of a nice book to anyone who can see the logic in it</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Rev. J. Ewing Reid, who presided, stated that he did not think it was necessary at all for the ministers to defend their attitude in the last war.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>ir</sup>Rev. R. J. Campbell said: 'Our pulpits were turned into recruiting stations and our churches into I don't know what. Our own </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ministers vers bribed into the war </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and made heroes of by their congregations, their increased and the highest paid ministers in the country were given chaplain positions? ”*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">More power to you, Christian (!) ministers, keep up the good work; and some day you will all tell the truth and agree with those awful Bible Studentswho have said all these things for you for a decade. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Another interesting item comes to our attention, and that is a church announcement appearing in the Montreal </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Daily Star</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Christ Church Cathedral, which appends a “Seats Free, No Collection” sign to its Sunday program. Perhaps the leaven is beginning to work after half a century's effort! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Bight to the Use of the Earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">, “Under the above heading Herbert Spencer devotes an eloquent chapter of his ‘Social Statics’ to proving . the incontrovertible equity of Socialism, in so far as it asserts the equal right of all man to the use of the earth on which they live. For assuming that ‘each of - them has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other, then each * of them ia free to uae the earth for the satisfaction of &lt;&nbsp;his wants, provided he allows all others the same liberty. And conversely, it ia manifest that no one mhy uae the * &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth in such a way as to prevent the rest from similarly</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using it; seeing that to do this ia to asauxne greater</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' freedom than the rest, and consequently to break the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This sentence very neatly puts out of court their graces the Dukes of Sutherland and Buo clench and those other seventy persons who own among them just one-half of the Scottish soil. He proceeds:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Equity, therefore, does not permit property in land. For if one portion of the earth's surface may justly become the possession of an individual, and may be held by him for his sola use and benefit, as a thing to which he haa an exclusive right, then other portions of the - • earth’s surface may be so held, and eventually the whole of the earth’s surface may be so held; and our planet may thus lapse altogether into private hands. Observe now the dilemma to which this leads. Supposing the entire habitable globe to be so enclosed, it follows that if the landowners haVe a valid right to its surface, all who are not landowners have no right at all to its surface. Hence such can exist on the earth by sufierance only. They are all trespassers. Save by permission of the lords of the soil, they an have no room for the soles of their feet. Nay, should the others think fit to-deny them a resting place, these landless men might equitably be expelled from the earth altogether.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">From this he has no difficulty in proving that an exclusive possession of the soil necessitates an infringement of the law of equal freedom. For men who cannot live and move and have their being without the consent of others cannot be equally free with those others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Original Deeds Secured bv Conquest '</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">B. SPENCEB then deals with the claims of the present possessors of land:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' &quot;It can never be pretended that the existing titles to such property are legitimate. Should anyone think so, let him look in the chronicles of violence, fraud, the prerogative of force, the claims of superior cunning— then are the sources to which those titles may be traced. The original deeds were written with the sword rather . than the pen; not lawyers but soldiers were the conveyancers; blows were the current coin given in payment; . and for seals, blood was used in preference to wax. Could valid *1*™* be thus constituted? Hardly And if not, what becomes of the pretensions of all subsequent holders of estates so obtained? Does sale or bequest generate a right where it did not previously exist? Would the original claimants be nonsuited at the bar of reason because the thing stolen Iran them had changed hands? Certainly not And if one. act of trane-fer can give no title, can many?&quot;No; though nothing be multiplied forever, it will not produce one. Even the law recognises this principle.**</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">He then proceeds to combat the arguments of those who assert that time is a great legalizer, and that immemorial possession must be taken to constitute a legitimate On grounds of pun equity he has no difficulty in proving the absurdity of this proposition, but he admits that great difficulty must attend the resumption of their rights to the soil by mankind at large. He does not advocate the leaving of the present holders, who can neither toil nor spin, to, starve. He says:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Men having got themselves into this </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">dilemma</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> by disobedience to the law, must get out of it as beet they can, and with as little injury to the landed class as may be. Meanwhile, we shall do well to recollect that there are others besides the landed class to be considered. In our tender regard for the vested interests of the few, let us not forget that the rights of the many are ia</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">abeyance, and must remain m as long aa the earth is monopolized by individuals. Let us remember, too, that the injustice thus inflicted on the mas* of mankind is an injustice of the gravest nature. The fact that it is not* to regarded proves nothing. But our civilization ia - only partial., It may by-and-by be perceived that Equity utters dictates to which we have not yet listened; and imd may then learn that to deprive others of their, righto to the um </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> the earth is to commit a crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">■ inferior only in wickedness to the crime of taking away their lives or personal liberties.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">First Usurper Is Satan</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">A, ND the devil, taking him up into an high a* mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said unto </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him, All</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will. I give it. If thou, therefore, wilt worship me<sub>y </sub>all shall be thine.&quot;—Luke 4:5-7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">“And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken ’ unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee:.for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.&quot;—1 Samuel 8:7^ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">God was rejected, and the devil became a usurper. And all the sin, crime, want, and unhappiness are the result of his diabolical pur-' pose to destroy all humanity. But his time is nearly up; for the rightful King is coming into His own to reign in righteousness, peace, and _ love. But first all the unrighteous work of the usurper will be destroyed; and it may be as well now to describe a few of the horrors which have, been perpetrated to gain possession of land under the usurper’s rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rapacity of Land Grabbers</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE following facts are taken from “The Christian Socialist&quot; of August 3, 1883. It mentions the “Highland Clearances&quot; by Alexander Mackenzie. The author of the book takes for his motto, “Truth Stranger than Fiction.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“We stand appalled at the long list of atrocities of which the Highlanders have been the victims, at the terrible details of the oppression* done in this wild world under the sun. Take, for instance, the administration of Sutherland by Mr. Sellar, the factor of infamous memory. In the, mouth of March, 1814, a great number of the tenants whose lands he intended to take for himself were summoned to give up their farms in the following May, and by his orders the heath pasture was set fire to, in order to hasten their removal.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The tenants, though perfectly submissive, were to have expected that they would be allowed a little time to coUeci their furniture and crops. Their consternation was therefore the greater when commencement was made to puH down and set fire to the houses over their • beads! The old people began to try to save their timber. But the destructors increased speed, demolishing all before them; and when they had overthrown the houses in a large part of the country, they set fire to thewreek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“These proceedings were carried on with the most reckless cruelty. The cries of the victims, the confusion, the despair and horror painted on the face* of one party, and the exulting ftfrocity of the other, beggar all description. In these scenes Mr. Sellar was present, ordering and directing the whole. Many deaths were caused from alarm, from fatigue, and cold, the people being instantly deprived of shelter, and left to the mercy of the weather. Pregnant women were taken with premature labor, and several children did not long survive. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I was. present at the pulling down and burning of I the house of William Chisholm, in which was Ijang his * wife’s mother, an old bedridden woman of near one hundred yean of age, none of the family being present | I informed the persons about to set fire to the house of ] this circumstance, and prevailed on -them to wait till Mr. Sellar came. On his arrival, I told him of thepoor <sub>f </sub>old woman being in a condition unfit for*removaL He I replied, Tamn her, the old witch t • She has lived fob * long; let her burn!’ Fire was immediately set-to the house, and the blankets in which she was carried: were in flames before she could be got out The old woman’s daughter arrived while the house was on fire; and assisted the- neighbors in removing her mother out of the flames and smoke, presenting a picture of horror which I shall never forget,, but cannot attempt to describe.' She died within five days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The above are the words of an eye-witness and have never been contradicted. Mr. Sellar was put upon trial, ‘chiefly for the purpose of satisfying the public mind, and putting an end to the clamors of the country/ as his counsel observed. If this, and not the ends of justice, was the intention it was completely successful; for the criminal was acquitted. . . . Sufficient to say, the whole countryside was lighted up with the </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">fl*™*</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the burning houses, which lasted for six days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“A tenant in 1830 sent an appeal in hie own name to the Marquis of Stafford. The result proved how weak , a just cause becomes when despotic landholders are appealed to. The man’s family was evicted, while he was at work forty miles away, in the winter time; and all the surrounding inhabitants were warned, at the peril of similar treatment, against affording them any shelter or assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Again, in 1845 similar scenes were carried out at Glencalvie and reported on by the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Timm</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> correspondent (the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Timm</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> then cost 6d). In 1853 'the massacre of the Bosses was perpetrated, because the people feebly</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">attempted to resist their evictors. The women stood in the way of the police. The sheriff gave the order tew attack them, and himself struck the first blow at a woman. Such, indeed, was the sad havoc made on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">' females on the banks of the Carron that pools of blood were on the ground, that the grass and earth were dyed red with it, that the dogs of the district came and licked it up; and at last, such was the state of f</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ading </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of parties that came from a distance to see the field that the ground* was harrowed up in the night to hide the Hood.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“One more instance illustrates the present system of slavery—for land is held the same now as then. In the summer of 1851 a.certain Colonel Gordon had decided</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">to ship his tenants bodily off to Canada (Take notice, &nbsp;</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sub>r</sub>—j — --------------—</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">please, land laws are the same today) from South Uist* families live it in earnest—God-fearing, honest, crime</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">and in the' Island of Bana. He and his men adopted the low-down methods of the slave-trader. The poor people were commanded under a penalty of £2 to attend a public meeting at Loch Boisdale, where the transports lay. At this meeting the natives were seized and, in spite of their entreaties, sent on board. One stout High-, lander* Angus Johnstone, resisted so strongly that ttey handcuffed him. One morning .during the transporting, season we were suddenly awakened by the screams of a young female who had been recaptured in an adjoining house, she having escaped after her first capture. We all rushed to the door, and saw the broken-hearted </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mar </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">tore with disheveled hair and swollen face, dragged away by two constables and a ground officer. But for the color of the slaves you would think you were on the slave coast of Africa.’*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Landlords may be less brutal than they were seventy years ago, yet the old tyranny and op-- pression remain. Starvation ip the preferred weapon today. It must be so as long as men , /are exposed to the temptations which the possession of unlimited wealth and absolute power engender.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">I will now reproduce an open letter published on behalf of the Vatersay fishermen who were evicted, tried, and convicted, and sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment, for returning to the island of Vatersay, from which their forefathers were evicted fifty years before:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Sir : I wish to thank you for the slip of the tongue which reveals yourself, and your class, and </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">man</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">y of your supporters in their true light, so that every working man can appreciate the insult which you have in an unguarded moment thrown at us, while you were defending the right of a lady to have absolute power to keep a portion of the earth’s surface a wilderness. Ten of the best of British toilers want more room and better conditions to obtain a living. Their forefathers fifty years ago were evicted from Vatersay.' Today they return with their families to obtain a living, as their fathers did before them, by spade culture and fishing; and for this sin against property and the class which you repr^ sent, these ten men an imprisoned, and while there insulted by you, and through them every working man in the United Kingdom. Who set you up to alter the decrees and commandments of the Lord God Almighty? You call them ‘parasites’ because they have doubled <sub>s </sub>their numbers in sixty years, and say that they ought not to be on the face of the earth. God’s first commandment to </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Tn an</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> was, Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What has Lady Gordon done to subdue Vatersay? What have you done to subdue it? Played golf on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">You play at life! These men and women and their unknown amongst them; yet you call them pansites who ought to have no place on God’s earth to live upon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“I once knew a working man who boasted of being a Tory and whose remedy for bad trade and want of work waa: ‘A good war with plenty of slaughter? Was this one of the reasons that war vM provoked and carried on in South Africa? Were the Highlanders slaughtered at Magersfontein to help the depopulation of the Highlands? It looks like it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">- “By what right db you and your ilk hold Jarge»tracta of land, and keep the people in a state of starvation and slavery upon it, and drive off those whom you cannot enslave? Does the land you domineer over bring forth abundantly? And what do you do towards its production? Has the earth produced its uttermost in this old country, which has been misgoverned for centuries? There is land enough to provide food in plenty to feed a population of two hundred n* ill inn—withant importation—the greater part of this landjwing idle. What right have you to reverse the commands of God, and say that it shall not be made fruitful or that man shall not multiply upon it?</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“What right have you to keep the millions of landless Britons whose land is wrongfully withheld from them, from reoccupying that land and obeying the commandments of their God? And who gave you the authority to dictate how many children they should have, or to forbid those children room to obev the commandment of God in their turn ? There is more infant life sacrificed by the worshipers of the Golden Calf today in one year than the children of Israel sacrificed during the reign of Ahab! It is true that they are not taken by force from their parents’ arms, but by a more barbarous system. The parents are helpless to prevent their being starved, stunted, and killed by unhealthful surroundings —murdered that you may have gold and land to keep as a wilderness.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Its tongue is 40 inches long; several thousand teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Its liver alone weighed 1,700 pounds, or more than ten full-grown men together.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It had swallowed an octopus weighing 400 pounds; a black fish weighing 1,500 pounds and 500 pounds of coral also found in its stomach. It could have swallowed forty Jonahs without the slightest pangs of indigestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">It smashed a boat into thousands of pieces and crushed the rudder and propeller of a 31-toa yacht with a single swish of its mighty tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Five harpoon thrusts and 150 large calibre rifle bullets served only to increase its fury, and five days were required finally to kill it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">The actual battle lasted thirty-nine hours—two days and a night—in open boat, in open sea, with the monster dragging a small boat at express train speed for hundreds of miles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">O CONFORM to the ways of the world is to have the spirit of the world. In the Bible it says: &quot;Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.&quot; (1 John 2:15) Men love the world, and have its spirit in order to be &quot;good mixers&quot; and to be popular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">National Humane Review</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> is authority for the statement that Bev. Billy Sunday, who </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> conducted a whirlwind evangelistic campaign at Charleston, S. C., went deer hunting with some .of his party, and adds: “The famous evangelist can see nothing incompatible with preaching the gospel of divine love for all creatures and, hunting innocent deer.” It quotes from the daily, press, stating that Mr. Sunday wounded a deer, and that another member of the party finally killed it Then comes the spectacular:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“It appears to be the custom in South Carolina </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">for </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">a successful hunter to HaVe his face smeared with the ' blood of his first deer; and Mr. Sunday had this highly edifying rite performed for him by Bev. Dr. William Way, one of the prominent Episcopal clergymen at „ Charleston.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Billy's mint consists in fooling the pepple, and Barnum thought they liked to be fooled. Pari of Billy’s fooling process is 'his measurable conformity to the ways of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">But our esteemed contemporary is mistaken in saying that Billy preaches the gospel of divine love for all creatures. No; that heaven has a few favorites; that everybody else is going to hell; and that Christ will render a judgment according to Sunday's theology, is Billy's thought In his prayers he instructs God and Christ as to what he wants done, and also informs us that when he.gets to heaven Ke intends to make other requests! -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">If Billy really understood divine love, he would not be killing deer; much less would he allow the blood to be smeared over his face. If Billy knew what divine love is and how it operates (1 Corinthians 13) we doubt that he would shoot at a deer even if he were seriously in need of food. There are other ways of killing animals for food or for any other reason besides taking chances of wounding them with lead bullets shot from a distance.</span></p>

He realizes that the Indians are in desperate need of material comforts and makes an appeal, .not that they may have the things that they need, but something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Snyder makes an appeal, but it is not for the Indians. It is for Father Snyder. If he can receive enough financial support, he is willing to stay where he is and add to the misery and wretchedness of these poor Indians by picturing before them the agonies of a purgatory which does not exist, a flaming hell which does not exist, and the doctrine of the inherent immortality of man, which is totally unscrip-turaL But let us hear </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">?</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">E HAVE another wail from a Roman _ Catholic priest in Marty, South Dakota, who wants some money. We quote in part from his letter:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Our people here are the poorest of God’s poor. In rags and tatters they live in wretched hovels, suffering from hunger and exposure. Asking for money from them is like begging for bread in Vienna. Bub I have gone on with my missionary work, trusting entirely in God and the charity of good people. The tiny allowance we get from the annual Indian-Negro Collection is used up in a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">&quot;For six years I have been ‘making the missions’ in my ‘Ford,’ climbing the gumbo hills and roaming the Dakota prairie. Sometimes the Ford is stuck in a creek or broken down, far from human help. These axe little trials, but the greatest trial ia to find oneself without means to cany on the work of earing souls. Our children, dirty and in rags, hardly know that there is a Providence above. They have not had the chance to learn iL A echoed with Sisters has been our dream for years. Good people are willing to give to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">specific case of need or distress. Here is a real one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“My dear friend, your offering will help; and it will be appreciated. I am willing to spend my life and all my energies for this weary work. I look for no earthly reward. Will you, too, do-something for these Indians' souls? The Whites robbed them of their land and liberty. Let us, at least, make some amends by sending them the gift of our Holy Faith t”</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Tell you what, Sylvester. If you really want to do something for those poor Indians, just crank up your old Liz; and while you still have the price of a tankful of gasoline left from the* last contribution, just head East and get as far away as the car will take you. The longer you stay the worse they are off; and the less of your unholy and diabolical faith about purgatory and hell fire you give them the happier they will be.

The item has reference to the experience of a group of International Bible Students who endeavored, in modern Hungary, to exercise their privilege of worshiping the Lord in accordance with the dictates of their own consciences. Moreover, these sufferers were threatened with the penalty of death in ease they should spread the news of. their ill-treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">In the face of this story the current claim of the Roman Catholic church in America that it is persecuted is enough to make a decent man ill with nausea. The Roman Catholic church is and has always been an association of heartless, hypocritical religious politicians, keeping the people in ignorance, devoted to war and bloodshed and every evil work. The fact that it has a religious exterior only makes its heartless conniving after wealth and power all themorw reprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Budapest, April 7,—In the parish of Bogacs, in the county of Borsod, about forty Protestant farmers met together. These had formed an association for Biblereading, in order to read and explain the Holy Scriptures and to sing psalnu. Suddenly, without warnings the gendarmes exitend the hall, seized the hymn-books and the Bibles, threw them out into the court, dedared. the men and women under arrest, and took them all* to. the town-halt The sergeant-major on duty, Tapolcsanyi, sentenced all the prisoners to a flogging of twenty-five strokes each, and the sergeant, Szabo, immediately executed the punishment. Then they were taken to the nearby village, Moszlay, where a similar Bible-study association exists. There the gendarmes went from house • to house, and likewise seized the hymnals and the Bibles, and dealt out considerable flogging at the same tuna. * The people were held prisoners for two days, then ra- ' leased under threat that unless they desisted from their ‘ activities, dangerous to tha State, they would ail bo * interned in Zala-Egerueg.”</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font10" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Preparing The Kings</span></h5>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Broadcast fmm WATCHTOWER WBBR on a ware length of 273 neters, by Judge J. P. Rutherford)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• TESUS of Nazareth, after He was raised from V the dead and glorified in heaven, dictated to St John the Book of Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">- At the time St. John was serving a prison term on the Isle of Patmos for the alleged violation of the Espionage Law of that time. Espionage laws have ever been used as a pretext for the persecution and the causing of suffering of those who dare tell the'truth concerning God’s plan. But the Lord always overrules what seems to be a calamity to the Christian, makes it work out to the Christian’s good and to the Lord’s glory. No man has been more highly honored than the supposed convict, St John, to receive at the hands of the Lord of glory this wonderful Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Book of Revelation gives a brief history of the Christian Church from its beginning until now. It points out that a time would come when the evil powers would be desperately arrayed * against the Lord in a great conflict, that these would make war against the Lord, and that He would overcome them; for He is Lord of lords 'and King of kings, and they that are with Him are called, and chosen, and faithful.—Revelation 17:14.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">This is proof that the Lord Jesus is the great King, and that He must come into Hi* kingdom, - and that He will have with Him others who, by His grace, will serve with Him as kings. Speaking in another part of the Book of Revelation to St. John, Jesus said concerning those that win be with Him: “They shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.” (Revelation 20:6) - This is another proof that they will be kings. Only kings reign with power and authority. The ones here referred to will occupy the most exalted positions in all of God’s universe, Jehovah alone excepted. It follows then, necessarily, that if these have such an exalted place that Jehovah would take much time and pains in preparing them. Even so it has been and is. It also necessarily follows that such must be exceptional characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Identification of the Kinge &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">I</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">S IT possible to identify those who will compose the class of kings </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> If so, by what means may we identify themf -Throughout the Scrip* tures this class is designated under different titles. St. Paul mentions them as- members of the body of Christ He sayb that Jesus is the Head of the body, the Church. (Colossians 1:1S) There has been great confusion in the minds of the people as to what constitutes the Church of Christ In the </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ATaTninat</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ion of this- subject we may consider the kings and the Church as synonymous terms referring to the same class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">St Peter, concerning the same riass, says: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> darkness into his marvelous light: which in time past were not a people, but are now the people </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> God; which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.”—1 Peter 2:9,10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Necessarily it follows that whoever is a member of this class must measure up to the standard laid down by the Apostle. The Jews thought that they were the ones; for God had previously '■ promised that they should be- unto Him a pecu- -liar people and a kingdom of priests. But they came far short, and today no Jew riaims to be of that class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">After our Lord had ascended on high, men organized bodies which- they, designate the church. Many Catholics have long thought that their organization is the one here mentioned by the apostle Peter. But when we come to apply the standard it can hardly be said that the Catholic church is a </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">holy</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> nation and. a royal priest; hood. With all due deference to Catholics; everyone informed of the facts knows that there has been much wrong done in the name of the Catholic church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Then came upon the scene the Protestant church denominations, such as the Lutheran, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, and others, each one in turn claiming to be </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> chosen ones of the Lord who should constitute the special associates in His kingdom. Again, when we apply the divinely given standard, we must see that none of these systems measures up to the requirements. You may ask, then: What earthly organization answers the description and meets the requirementsT I reply: There is no earthly organization; nor did God intend for any earthly organization to have this honor. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Paul speaks of this class in these words, as &quot;the church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven.’* (Hebrews </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">12</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">:23) He does not say that their names are written oh some earthly church book, nor that they are designated as clergy or laymen or have any peculiar dress or marks visible to man. The Lord judges according to the secret intent of the heart. He knows the inmost thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">How the Kings An Selected '</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">S</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">INCE the ones here mentioned are to be associated with Jesus as kings and priests, we should expect to find both the qualifications required and the manner of selection set forth in the Bible. Even so it is. St Paul, in discussing this matter in his epistle to the Hebrews, states that the Lord did not lay hold upon angels of whom to make these kings, but laid hold upon the seed of Abraham. By this we understand him to mean those who possess the faith, like unto Abraham. Abraham is known as the father of the faithful, and the first essential to pleasing God is to have faith. That is to say, one must believe that God exists, and that He is the rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. (Hebrews 11:6) None others are to be considered. Faith means (1) an intellectual understanding and appreciation of the Bible as God’s Word of Truth given for the guidance of man relative to his salvation, and (2) a confident reliance upon that Word. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Those who are selected to be kings and priests are taken from amongst men. The first thing essential is repentance, which means a change of mind. One has been following the course of worldly men. He deter</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">es in his </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">mind</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> that he has been taking the wrongful course, and wants to serve the Lord. That is repentance. The next step is conversion, which means a change of course of action. When he turns away from following after the world and seeks the Lord Jesus, then he is properly said to be converted. The next step is laid down by the Lord in- these words: &quot;If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me; for whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it&quot; (Matthew 16:24,25) To deny oneself means to agree to do what another would direct. This means that the one turning away from the world and seeking the Lord is</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">plainly told that he must surrender himself unto the Lord, agreeing to do the Lord’s will Thisr is properly called consecration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;: -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The real desire of the one who now consecrates </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">himself</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to the Lord is that he might be in full harmony with God and enjoy the blessings of life everlasting. To him Jesus says: &quot;I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no man' cometh unto the Father but by me.” (John 14^ 6) Otherwise stated, one seeking the Lord must recognize that he was born a sinner, that Jesus provided the ransom price for </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that the<sup>j </sup>only way to get back into harmony with God is■ to exercise faith in this great truth of the ransom sacrifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The next step is justification, which means ■ being made right with God. The Apostle says :' &quot;By faith are we justified&quot;; and again, &quot;By the '• blood of Jesus are we justified”; and again, &quot;It is God who justifies.” Thus we see that there are three steps: (1) Our faith in the Lord and in His provisions for us; (2) the application of the merit of Christ, designated as His life-blood; and (3) the judicial determination by Jehovah that we are right; and this is justification. Otherwise stated, when one presents himself in full consecration, Jehovah says to him, in substance: 'Because of your faith in-the blood of my beloved Son, because that blood has been applied for you, I therefore determine that through His merit you are right with me* I justify you.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Now, says the apostle Paul: &quot;Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.” (Romans 5:1) To have this peace with God means to be in harmony with </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him.</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> He who is justified has the right to live as a human being.. There is but one reason why God has justified any one during the Gospel Age, and that is that such might become a member of the sacrificial body of our Lord. Jesus was actually perfect when He was offered as a sacrifice. Those who will compose the body members of Christ are counted by Jehovah as perfect human beings when accepted; and this perfection is counted to them by reason of the merit of His beloved Son, Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The next step is the begetting, which means the beginning of the new creature in Christ. St James says that God, by His Word, exercising His own will, does this begetting. (James 1:18) St Peter states that these are begotten to ahope oflife, to an inheritance incorruptible reserved in heaven for those who are faithful, unto the end. Such a one who is thus begotten, is -properly said to be in Christ Jesur. Now adds the Apostle: “If any man be in Christ he is a new- creature.” From that time forward God counts </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">him</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> a new creature, because his hopes and prospects for-life everlasting are heavenly and not earthly..^</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The next step is the anointing. Jehovah does the anointing through Christ Jesus. St. John, speaking to these, says: “Ye have an unction [an anointing] through the Holy One, and ye all know it.” The Prophet puts the words into the mouth of the Christian thus: &quot;The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me; because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto / the meek: he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and. the opening of the prison to them that are &quot;bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the ' Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.” (Isaiah 61:1,2) Is he who has now become a, Christian ready for heaven? I answer: No. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• ■ »•</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Tint,’ says one, T have always understood that if I repented and was converted and baptized in water I was ready for heaven if I died instantly.’ This is what we have been taught; but it is not what the Bible teaches. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">It must appeal to the reasonable mind thus: Thai if God is to select from amongst fallen men those whom He will exalt to the highest places in the universe, they must go through a course of training; and that He would not beget such to the divine nature and take them immediately to heaven without first giving them a chance to demonstrate loyalty to God. Jesus said concerning the Christian: &quot;Narrow is the way, and few there be that find it.” We can now understand why the way is narrow. It is not an easy matter to be a Christian, but it is the greatest privilege ever granted to any creature in the universe. It is the invariable rule that he who receives a great and lasting-reward must receive it after strenuous and tremendous effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Training of These Kings</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">M</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">ILLIONS have been deceived into the thought that they would go to heaven and be forever with the Lord; yet Jesus plainly</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">states that only a little flock will be of that class. (Lake 12: 32) There are far more people , on Manhattan Island alone than will ever be of the heavenly kingdom class, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Millions of &quot;people have been deceived by the. teachings- of men to the effect that a Christian ' ' can actively engage in the politics of this world and resort to all the other means employed by the world in fraudulent schemes, and still be the chosen ones of the Lord. St. Paul plainly says: “Be not conformed .to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God.” (Bomans 12:2) The word world here means the order of&quot; society: Otherwise stated, St Paul says: Do not fashion-yourself after the habits of the world, saying, I must do thus and so because somebody else does, because it is the fashion- of my community, I must do what they do.' • &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/'</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Whoever will be a king and priest unto God . must follow the way pointed out by the Lord. not a way pointed, out by man. To be trana--formed means to be made over. It means to ga. contrary to the downward tendency of human kind. It means to follow-in the footsteps of Jesus. No man- can with one foot follow after the world, and with the other foot try to follow&quot; ■ the Lord., He may succeed in deceiving the. people, but he cannot for a moment deceive, the Lord. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Peter says to the Christian, who has once started: “For even hereunto were ya called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.” (1 Peter 2:21) This scripture proves conclusively that the Christian must follow in the Master's footsteps, that he must copy the Master’s example:.and to do so will entail upon ' him suffering at the hands of others, even those who cl</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">aim</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">From time immemorial three elements have composed the ruling factors of the earth; namely, commercial, political, and ecclesiastical organizations, combined together. These are called in the Scriptures the world, the ruling power. These advocate war, and make temporary peace. They sanctify war, and urge others to go to the battlefield and take their fellow creatures' lives. To the Christian the Lord says: “Thau shalt not IqlL” If the worjdwishx. to kill each other, that is their business. The commission of the Christian is to do something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Jesus was misunderstood and misrepresented by the scribes and the Pharisees and others of the clergy of his time. They eaused Him to be accused of practically every crime known to the criminal calendar; yet He was holy, harmless, and without sin. It has. ever been thus throughout the Gospel Age. Any </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">pinn,</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> or class of men and women, who dares to represent the Lord exclusively, has suffered persecution at the hands of others. Many of the world, not understanding this, have looked upon Christians as the offscourings of the earth. It is even so today. And why is it T</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus answered that question in these words: “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen, you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also. But all these things will they do unto' you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.&quot; —John 15:19-21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Suffering Necatary to Prove Loyalty &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">TTTC</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> Lord makes it a condition precedent that he who will enter the courts of glory as a king must do so by way of the path of suffering. The adverse conditions afford an opportunity of proving his loyalty to the Lord. Fidelity, faithfulness, loyalty, is that which is pleasing to the Lord. The true Christian has never regretted that he was called upon to suffer. On the contrary he has been comforted by the Lord's example and His Word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For instance, as St. Peter says: &quot;Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.&quot; (1 Peter 4:12-14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">What a fraud has been practised upon men to induce them to join some church and then to . tell them: ‘Now if you die you are certain to ' * go to heaven,' ignoring entirely the require- j. meats to be a real associate of the Lord! -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The apostle Paul plainly says that he who is, ‘ a Christian must be an ambassador of Christ. ; An ambassador is the visible representative &lt;&nbsp;*• an absent king. Every true Christian then upon the earth, since the 'day our Lord ascended on high, has been, and is, an ambassador of Christ It becomes the duty of an ambassador to represent the great King of kings and Lord of lords. His specialty, his vocation, is faithfully and loyally to represent his King. To do so, of course, will mean that he will suffer at the hands of the god of this world, Satan, and of his representatives. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">As a further evidence that suffering with . Christ is an essential thing, the Apostle says: : &quot;If we suffer, we shall reign with him; if we' deny him, he also will deny us.* (2 Timothy 2:12) To deny the Lord would mean to repo-diate His Word, His kingdom, and His plan of salvation. To be His faithful and loyal ambas- , sador and to proclaim the message of the Lords I kingdom would entail suffering upon the one . who does these things. The Apostle makes it . ■ dear that the latter course is a condition precedent to becoming a king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The Lord Jesus emphasizes this fact when He says to the one who has begun to follow id His footsteps: &quot;Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.* (Revelation 2: 10) The crown of life is the highest element of life, the divine nature. Our Lord's statement * means that such will be associated with our Lord; for to such He says: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.”—Revelation 3:2L</span></p>

<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">C</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">AN we tell now just who will be of that class, who will be with the Lord, and who will not! I answer: We cannot It is not for us to Hotp-r</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">min</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">o But we may follow this as a general rule: That he who advocates and supports the unrighteous principles and systems of this present order and denies the Lord and His plan of. salvation will never be of that class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"><sub>o</sub> . .The Apostle says that God has set the mem. <sub>t</sub> hers in the body as it pleaseth Him. He knows what they must do, and He-judges them according to the secret intent of their heart in-doing as best they can what their hands find to do. Ve may approximate who'some of them are by the course that 'they persistently follow. As an .. ambassador of Christ, each one is commissioned t® do certain things; namely, to proclaim the</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">message of Christ's kingdom* to declare His plan of salvation, to bind up the broken-hearted, to comfort those that mourn. Anyone who is ■ honestly and ^earnestly striving to- do this be<sub>;</sub> cause of his l&lt;5ve for the Lord and for the Lord’s cause we can reasonably expect is pleasing to , the Lord. But he who advocates war and urges young men to go to the battlefield, himself pos-. ing as a Christian, and at the same time tells ’ young men that if they die upon the battlefield they will go straight to heaven, certainly could not be of that class. Such have not the spirit of •• Christ Jesus. St Paul says: “If any man have ' not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”— ' Bomans 8:9.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Honored of the Lord ' .</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HE Lord permits His true followers to be -misunderstood, misrepresented, persecuted, imprisoned, and even killed for truth and right. eousness* sake. He permits them to be despised amongst men, misrepresented by the public press and the ruling powers.- These agencies : blind tho.people to the true arrangement of the Lord. But in God's own due time He will make - known to the people who constitute this class , of- kings and priests. Concerning them His prophet wrote: “And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her; and the Highest himself shall establish her. The Lord shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this man was born there.”—Psalm 87: 5,6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Future Office One of Ruling</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">HOSE who will compose the kings with Christ Jesus are otherwise designated in the Scriptures as the new creation. The\ Lord has employed many centuries in preparing them. This of itself is an argument of the importance attached to their, selection and qualifications. Now remember the promise that God made to Abraham when He said: “In thy seed shall all -families of the earth be blessed.” Then call</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">to mind St Paul’s definition of the seed: &quot;As many of you as-are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ . . . And if ye be Christ's, the* are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:27,29) Thus definitely is fixed the purpose for which these kings are prepared. . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;■</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Many an honest person has wandered whether or not he would go to,heaven. He has no evidence that he is rn-nning for the heavenly prize; he is wondering what the future holds. Many have said: If only a few will be in heaven, what' will become of the millions of others T</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">My answer is, These will have an opportunity of receiving earthly blessings. These blessings will be administered to them by the kings and priests of God and of Christ, the seed,of Abraham according to the promise. Millions of people now on earth will soon have the opportunity of coming to a full knowledge of the truth, and of understanding God’s provision and mitering'., into the blessings that He promised; namely, life, liberty, and happiness. Concerning this th* prophets foretold the coming times of restoration of man to the condition of perfection ofi body and mind. St. Peter, at Pentecost, declared: “He [God] shall send; Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom th* heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since-the world began.”—Acts 3:20,21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Jesus said to His disciples, and through them to all other Christians who are faithful: “Ye which have followed me, in the regeneration, . when the Son of man </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">shall</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> ait in the throne, of his glory, ye shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel” (Matthew 19:. 28) This means that they, with Christ Jesus,, will be judging the families of the earth for the purpose of blessing man. The apostle Paul corroborated this when he said: &quot;Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world F—1 Corinthians 6:2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Time for the Kingdom</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">T</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">IME is an important element of the Lord’s plan. He does everything in due time and exactly on time. We may know that the time of the completion of the kings, the time of their exaltation, and the beginning of their reign, will be just in the Lord’s due time. Jesus, when H*</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">was on earth, said to His followers: “I go </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">prepare a place for you. . . I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” (John 14:2,3) Based upon this, Christians have been, throughout the Gospel Age, waiting and hoping for the time of the coming of the Lord and the setting up of His kingdom. The apostle Paul pointed out that the Lord Jesus would have a special blessing for everyone who would love His second coming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">You may be able to answer the question for yourself as to whether or not you are in line for this special blessing. Do you love the second . coming of the Lord? Are you anxious to know</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">. *</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">about that? The Scriptures show that the sec- I ond coming of the Lord, the setting up of His ' kingdom, and the blessing of mankind closely <sup>; </sup>synchronize with the time of the end of the . world. Therefore the end of the world is a most important factor in the divine plan, both with reference to the Christian and with reference to the world in general From the Scriptural proof submitted you see that the kings are Jesus and those of </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Hi*</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> followers who are faithful unto death and who shall participate in the first resurrection and be associated with Him in heaven. Thbse shall be united with Him for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• the performance of the duties of kings at the end of the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">TT AVING been a subscriber to your magazine , -tA for quite a long time, and reading therein occasionally the doings of present-day ministers and some of their &quot;flock,&quot; I am sending you a clipping from an English paper which might interest you, if you have not already seen one; It just shows to what length these so-called , * &quot;shepherds* will go, to gather their flock into the fold, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">I think</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> the Bishop of Ripon, along with the other clergymen, had better'chuck up their jobs, if they can't respect the Creator better than they do. What do you say!</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The clipping which is from a Leeds, England, paper, follows:</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“ The Creator, resplendent in robes of shining gold, and wearing a gorgeous crown, was personified in the Church of St Edward, Holbeck, tonight, in the first performance in England of Hofmannsthal's mystery passion play, &quot;The Great World Theatre.'</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The play was produced in this suburban church by Edith Craig, the daughter-in-law of Ellen Terry, under the auspices of the Leeds Art Theatre, and with the consent of the Bishop of Ripon. Lord Halifax was a member of the audience, which was composed largely of clergymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The play opened in darkness, the only sound being the voices of an invisible choir heard faintly to an organ accompaniment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Suddenly there was the odor of inc</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">ensa</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"> • and then gradually the church was suffused with a dim blue light, mealing prelates and sibyls, ghostly figures in vestments, moving quickly and silently up ths side aisles to</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">the chancel, which had been converted to a stage heavily draped with multicolored curtains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' ,</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“While they stood expectantly outside ths Master’s . door, a magnificent, arrogant figure in purple </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:line-through;">r</span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">obes Mise Kathleen Ellis—representing the World, swept down the main aisle, followed by her minions, Curiosity -and Death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Faintly, almost imperceptibly, a light appeared in- -side the altar screen, and then suddenly tbs man who was God—in the play—was revealed bathed in golden radiance. He commanded the World to prepare a play, and appointed Death to be stage manager.. ■</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“There was darkness again, then the stage was taken by characters in shrouds of greenish hua^ represmting disembodied souls, from whom the acton were chosen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The angel representing the world gave knightly armor to the Sing, sumptuous gowns to the rich man. an axe to the peasant, costly fabrics for beauty, nuns' robes for wisdom, and rags for the beggar; but whan the soul of the beggar saw his part, which meant misery after misery, he rebelled. ' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’ *</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“Then followed the great climax of the play. The beggar was about to kill the angel when seraphic figures appeared aloft singing with angelic voices, while the organ bunt forth with joyous melody, and the stage was flooded with light. He accepted his part, and fell on his knees in prayer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“After a brief pause the stage waadarkened, and there was a grotesque dance by Death, an eerie figure, before he dismissed the souls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Creator appeared again in the final scene to bless the acton, now ghosts, for the parts they had played, with the exception of the rich man, who lay prostrate on the edge of the stage, ignored by the souls that had been saved.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">r^When Jesus was on earth He taught the people in parables or dark sayings. His disci- . pie? came to </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Him</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> and asked: “Why speakest thou unto them in parables 1 He answered and saiil unto them, Because it is given- unto you. to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.” (Matthew 13:10, 11) It will be observed that He did not say, fYou now know the mysteries of God*; but that it was given them to know those mysteries. Not even His disciples understood Him in many things when they were with Him. On the last night before His crucifixion He was instructing them in various things that would be helpful to them in the days to come. On that occasion He said: “When he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; hut whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things-to-come.” (John 16:13) The spirit of truth here mentioned is the holy spirit, the spirit of God, the invisible power operating upon the minds of those who are in covenant relationship .with God. Jesus here used the masculine pronoun in speaking of the holy spirit. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">““The holy spirit was given, to the disciples at Pentecost, that is to say, fifty days after the .resurrection of Jesus? “And when the day of <sub>(</sub>Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the holy spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.” (Acts </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2:1-4) </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The King James Version of our Bibles translates the word here holy &quot;ghost,” but there is no warrant for such a translation. It comes 'from the word which means spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">•“It was at Pentecost that for the first time God’s great mystery began to be understood by the disciples. The mystery of God has been a stumbling block to both Jews and Christians so-called; but in God’s due time He will make known to all the secret of His mystery; and then.all rightly .exercised by.this will rejoice with exceeding joy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">•&quot;The mystery is the Christ,-the great one through whom redemption, deliverance and. blessing will ultimately .come to -all mankind who receive Christ and obey Him. God foreshadowed His mystery for ages by the use of various men, yet all that time kept it secret.</span></p>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">•“Death has been and is the great enemy of man. Death is the very opposite of life. The greatest desirO of man is and always has been to have life everlasting in happiness. From the time of his expulsion from Eden man has been looking for something upon which to fasten a. hope for life and happiness. Satan was the cause of death; and when God pronounced the sentence in Eden He said that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent’s heath This statement was in the nature of a promise,, but it could not then be understood, Shoe Pento-eost some have understood the meaning of these-words to be an assurance that in God’s due timd the seed of promise, the seed of the woman, will destroy* Satan, who has the power of death.. Nearly two thousand years rolled by after this. before anything further was promised.</span></p>
