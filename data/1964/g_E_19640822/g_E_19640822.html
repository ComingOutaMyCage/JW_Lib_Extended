<p><span class="font18">HEN you were in school did you ever sit in class and daydream until the teacher</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">jolted you to reality by speaking ■=■ your name and asking: “Are you listening?” It was important for</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">you to listen so that you would learn what was being taught. Throughout your life listening plays an important role in your learning process. How well you learn things or follow directions depends to a great extent upon how well you listen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Possibly you are one of the many people who only half listen, with the result that when you are introduced to a person you forget his name in a matter of minutes. Do you blame your memory? Usually the reason you forget his name so quickly is that you fail to listen when it is told you. Pay close attention when his name is mentioned and repeat it to make certain you heard it correctly, and during the course of the conversation use it several times. It will then stay with you for a longer period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You are listening when you hear with thoughtful attention, but if your attention is not focused on what is being said, the words that are spoken fall on deaf ears. Whether you are speaking with someone or strolling through the woods, you will get greater enjoyment from life and learn more by paying attention to what you hear. Listen to the sounds around you.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">When in the woods give attention to the distinctive sounds of the various birds. See if you can distinguish one variety from another. Listen to the woodpecker chipping his way into a tree, to the sounds of the squirrels as they scamper about, to the gurgle of a stream and to the sound of the wind passing through needles of pine trees or through the leaves of other trees. The various sounds of a woodland contribute to its beauty and its fascination for man. But you miss much of the pleasure if you do not listen to its distinctive sounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A real test of your ability to listen comes when you sit in an audience that is being addressed by a public speaker. Whether his talk is for ten minutes or for one hour, it usually is not easy to keep your mind centered on what is said unless he is an exceptionally good speaker. To keep your mind on a talk being delivered by a less capable speaker requires effort. Like a restless child who sits quietly for a few minutes but then squirms and strives to run off to do something else, the mind strives to wander when a speaker lacks the ability to hold its attention. For you to learn from what he has to say, you must make a conscious effort to prevent this wandering and to focus your mind on the talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You have to pull down a mental curtain on the extraneous thoughts that seek to intrude on your conscious mind and to distract you. If you permit your mind to wander you can miss whole sections of the talk and not have the slightest idea of the good points the speaker may have brought out in those sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The mind has the peculiar ability to shut out sounds. A ticking, clock, for example, is not noticed by the person who becomes used to it. He ceases to become conscious of the clock’s sound. So too with a speaker, especially one that does not have a captivating manner of speaking. Unless you concentrate on what he is saying, your mind can wander to other things and shut out his voice so that it becomes a distant, sleep-inducing drone. When this happens, you are not learning anything. Inasmuch as you made the effort to come to the talk, you might as well benefit from the time you spend there by listening to what is being said. Even when it is the speaker’s fault that your mind tends to wander, try to pick enough out of the talk so that you could briefly summarize its content.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To keep your mind focused on a talk, you must keep it active by thinking about what is being said. Analyze the information the speaker is giving and strive to tie it in to his theme. What are the main points that he is developing? Is his reasoning sound? Does he present satisfactory proof for what he says? Compare the information he gives with what you already know on the subject. Be alert for information that you might be able to use. A real gem can be missed entirely if you permit your mind to wander. By taking a few notes throughout the talk, you can help your mind to keep centered on it. With good reason the Bible tells us: “A wise person will listen and take in more instruction.” (Prov. 1:5) He realizes that he can learn by being attentive to what other persons say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Listening is just as important in the process of communication as is talking. There is no purpose in talking to a person if he is not listening to what you say. You can no more get your ideas across to his wandering mind than if you were speaking to a mindless statue. As you expect other persons to listen to what you say, so you should listen to them. Show a speaker on a platform the same courtesy you expect from others by being attentive. The speaker, of course, has the responsibility to prepare a talk that is worth the attention of the audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A good listener realizes that he does not know everything. Because other persons may have information that will add to his fund of knowledge, he will listen attentively to what they have to say, being alert for new bits of information, useful arguments and thoughts that might help create new ideas and viewpoints. He also realizes that it is easy to get into the habit of daydreaming when someone is speaking to an audience whether large or small. It is especially easy to get into this habit if he listens to a number of talks every week. So he must make a definite effort to resist the habit by concentrating on what the speaker is saying, not permitting his mind to wander to other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">If you make the effort to congregate with others for the purpose of hearing instructive talks, do not misuse your time and the time of the speakers by not listening. Maintain a rein on your mind so that it does not wander aimlessly but keeps focused on what the speakers say. By listening attentively you can grow in knowledge and understanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font23">A</span><span class="font18">LL told, there are upward of 910 million professed Christians in the world today. Of these, more than five-ninths are said to be Roman Catholics, as also are from 90 to 99 percent of the people in some twenty lands in Europe, Central and South America. In certain Protestant countries, such as Great Britain and Denmark, the head of the State is also the head of the Church. Even the</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">On the basis of such facts you might expect that there is widespread Christian thinking in Christendom, but is there? No, there is not. Actually, there is so little Christian thinking manifested that some even despair of there being any Christian mind today. Among such is the English writer Harry Blamires. In his book </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian Mind</span><span class="font18"> he laments that “there is no longer a Christian mind.” As he sees it, “the modern mind has been secularized [and] deprived of any orientation toward the supernatural. The Christian mind has succumbed to the secular drift with a degree of weakness and nervelessness unmatched in Christian history.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">He spares neither the “laity” nor the clergy. Of the former he says: “Though he does not face it, the loyalty of the average Churchman to the Conservative Party or to the Labor Party is, in practical matters, prior to his loyalty to the Church.” And regarding the bishops and the clergy he states: “Neither our bishops nor our clergy give us leadership in thinking Christianly about the contemporary world. What we lack is not scholarly bishops but thinking bishops and preeminently Christianly thinking</span></p>

The scholar is not, by the mere fact of his scholarship a more religious, a more spiritual, a less secular [person]. The idea that because a man is learned, especially in subjects pertaining to religion, he is therefore secure from the seductions of worldliness is a fallacy.”</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark9"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark10"></a>What Is Christian Thinking?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Throwing light on this question by way of contrast is the following confession made some years ago by the popular American clergyman, John Haynes Holmes, recently deceased:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“I have found incalculable help and guidance in recent years in taking Gandhi as my example. If I have been tempted to write an angry letter, I have asked myself, ‘Would Gandhi write such a letter?’ If I have been irritated by some selfish boor who has stolen my time to serve his own designs and purposes, I have said to myself, ‘How would Gandhi treat this person?’ If I have found myself perplexed as to what to do in this Instance or that, I have again and again inquired within my heart, ‘What would Gandhi tell me to do if I should ask him?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">From this quotation it is quite apparent that the late pastor of New York City’s Community Church confessed to Gandhian thinking. Even as Gandhi was Holmes’ example, should not Christians set up Jesus Christ as their example? For one to do Christian thinking would mean for one to ask oneself: “Would </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font18"> write such a letter?” “How would </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font18"> treat this person?&quot; “What would </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Christ</span><span class="font18"> tell me to do if I should ask him?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The answers to such questions are not hard to find. They are recorded for us in the Christian Greek Scriptures and particularly in the four Gospels. Therein we find what principles governed Jesus Christ, how he dealt with various problems that came up in his life and the truths and rules of action he laid down for his followers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">From those Scriptures we see that Jesus Christ himself had a guide to direct him, his Father’s Word, the Hebrew Scriptures, of which he said, “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) He accepted the Mosaic writership of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible and, more than that, he considered them authentic and inspired. His ministry shows that he accepted as historical the account of creation, the Deluge, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the record of Abraham, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">To have Christian thinking on these matters would therefore mean for us to believe as Jesus did about them rather than adopting the theories and speculations of the higher critics and evolutionists. The writer of the </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrated London News</span><span class="font18"> (Nov. 2, 1963) who not long ago observed that “there are remarkably few instances in which Darwin’s theory has been tested, as all scientific theory should be tested, by practical work” was understating the matter. As evolutionist the late Sir Arthur Keith admitted, “Evolution is unproved and improvable. We believe it only because the only alternative is special creation, and that is unthinkable.” But special creation is not unthinkable to those who do Christian thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The entire tenor of the ostensibly Christian higher criticism is to disparage the Hebrew Scriptures, but Jesus appealed to them as his authority all through his earthly ministry. Thus each time the Tempter approached him Jesus countered with, “It is written,” even as he appealed to the same Authority to show which is the first and greatest commandment and that the dead will have a resurrection. Christian thinking is Christ’s manner of thinking, and that is in line with the inspired Word of his Father, Jehovah God. —Matt. 4:4, 7, 10; 22:29-40.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark11"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark12"></a>Christian Thinking on God's</span><br><br><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark13"></a>Name and Kingdom</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">The lack of Christian thinking today is also seen by the way many religious leaders speak disparagingly of God’s name, terming it a “solecism,” and by their leaving it out of their Bible translations altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In striking contrast to such men, Jesus Christ throughout his ministry made prominent his Father’s name. Did he not make the sanctifying of his Father’s name the very first petition of his model prayer for his followers? “Let your name be sanctified,” or, “Hallowed be thy name.” His own prayers manifest the same concern for his Father’s name: “Father, glorify your name.” “I have glorified you on the earth ... I have made your name manifest to the men you gave me out of the world. . . . Holy Father, watch over them on account of your own name which you have given me ... I have made your name known to them and will make it known.” Yes, from the inspired Record we see that Christian thinking exalts God’s name, which name is Jehovah.—Matt. 6:9; John 12:28; 17:4, 6, 11, 26; Isa. 42:8.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The way professed Christians put first their loyalty to worldly governments is further evidence of the lack of Christian thinking. They are first Americans, Frenchmen, Italians, and only after that “Christians,” as is so dear in time of war when Catholic kills Catholic and Protestant kills Protestant. This lack is also seen in the support professed Christians give to such human schemes as the United Nations and Godless Communism—for which 25 percent of “Christian” Italians voted in the latest elections—-instead of putting their hope in God’s kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Christian thinking, as exemplified by Jesus Christ, is oriented to the kingdom of God. That kingdom was the theme of his sermons, his parables and his prophecies. Throughout his ministry he stressed its importance. He had nothing in common with the kingdoms of the world, even as he said to Pontius Pilate: “My kingdom is no part of this world.” When men wanted to make him king forcibly, he withdrew. He was not interested in politics.—John 18:36; 6:14, 15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The lack of Christian thinking betrayed by the youths in Roman Catholic parochial schools whose highest aspirations were found to be money and pleasure is but indicative of the thinking of professed Christians in general.<a name="footnote1"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> Jesus’ words go unheeded by them: “Stop storing up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break in and steal. Rather, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. No one can slave for two masters . . . You cannot slave for God and for Riches. Keep on, then, seeking first [God’s] kingdom and his righteousness.”—Matt. 6:19-21, 24, 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">* See </span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Christian Century,</span><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;"> May 23, 1962.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark15"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark16"></a>Christian Thinking as to Witnessing</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">The Christian’s obligation to witness is another aspect in which there is a woeful lack of Christian thinking in Christendom. For most professed Christians the sum of Christian duty is to go to church on Sunday and keep the Ten Commandments. Far from witnessing, they do not even think it important to take in knowledge about Jehovah God and Jesus Christ, as is apparent from the widespread Bible illiteracy in the United States, Canada and other lands. Thus, according to George W. Goth, president of the United Church’s London conference, the churches are filled with people who do not know or understand the Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">How different all this is from the pattern of Christian thinking set by Jesus Christ! He was continually bearing witness to the truth; no wonder he was known as the “Teacher.”<sup><a href="#bookmark14">1</a></sup> More than that, he trained and commissioned his disciples to be teachers. That he intended this obligation to rest upon all his followers is apparent from his parting instructions: “Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">all the things I have commanded you”</span><span class="font18"> It is therefore not surprising to read that those who had been scattered from Jerusalem because of persecution “went through the land declaring the good news of the word.” —John 13:13; Matt. 28:19, 20; Acts 8:4.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Christian Thinking as to Conduct</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Even as there is a woeful lack of Christian thinking in regard to the obligation to bear witness, so there is a woeful lack in the world today as to Christian conduct. Far from heeding Jesus’ words, “Just as you want men to do to you, do the same way to them,” professed Christians by and </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">large </span><span class="font18">follow their selfish inclinations. Their pride, ambition and ruthless competition stand in stark contrast to the mildness and lowliness of mind that Jesus displayed and of which he spoke: “Come to me, all you </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font18">are toiling and loaded down, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you and become my disciples, for I am mild-tempered and lowly in heart.’’—Luke 6: 31; Matt. 11:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Jesus also set a high standard of sexual morality. He taught that “everyone that ! keeps on looking at a s woman so as to have a passion for her has i already committed ; adultery with her in i his heart.” But today popular entertainment in Christendom is to a great extent given over to this very thing and some of its grossest forms come from a land that is supposed to be 99 percent Christian, Roman Catholic, namely, Italy. Jesus also taught that the only grounds for divorce with remarriage is adultery, but today divorces are being granted for all manner of specious reasons: incompatibility, “mental cruelty,” and what not. What a lack of Christian thinking all such conduct betrays!—Matt 5:28; 19:3-9.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>Why Is Christian Thinking Lacking, and Where Can It Be Found?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Why this lack of Christian thinking among professed Christians? According to a Chicago professor of Christian Ethics, the reasons for the present state of professedly religious denominations are: “(1) other forces have minimized, diluted or rendered meaningless the Bible insights as they pertain to Society, or (2) ministerial leadership has been unwilling or unable to make clear the relationship between religious life and community responsibility, ... or perhaps both.”<a name="footnote2"></a><sup><a href="#bookmark21">2</a></sup> In concluding this way he is not far wrong, for the materialistic and faithless appeals by commercialism to human weaknesses and selfishness, together with the failure of the religious leaders, because of their selfishness or lack of faith and enlightenment, to preach the truth of God’s Word, without doubt account for much of the lack of Christian thinking in Christendom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">NONREASONING TRAVELERS </span><span class="font21" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">BUT</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19640822_files/g_E_19640822-5.png" alt="" style="width:24pt;height:21pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">ITH the coming of fall, millions of birds in the Northern Hemisphere take to the wing and head south in a mass migration that carries some of them many thousands of miles. High-flying ducks and geese pass in formation over after city without the benefit of radio beacons and other electronic guidance systems that keep human air travelers from becoming lost. At lower altitudes clouds of smaller birds pass by with equal disregard for knowledge about the science of navigation. How is it possible for these nonreasoning creatures to navigate accurately over great distances while intelligent humans are unable to do it without the aid of precision-made instruments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The songbirds known as warblers live in north European countries during the spring and summer, but in September they begin heading south. Their destination is Africa, including its southern part. Although this is a trip of several thousand miles, they navigate it with surprising accuracy. Unlike ducks, the warblers do not make the trip in groups that follow leaders. Each is an individual traveler.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Possibly the longest route that is flown by migrating birds is that followed by Arctic terns. Every year they make a round trip between the Arctic and the Antarctic, with some flying a distance of about 25,000 miles. With equally good navigational ability, the bristle-thighed curlew flies 6,000 miles from Alaska to Tahiti in a migratory flight. For , more than 2,000 miles of this trip, between Alaska and the</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">city</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">Hawaiian Islands, the birds must fly nonstop over open ocean with no landmarks to help them to find their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Not even a previous knowledge of a route is necessary for migratory birds to fly accurately to their destination, although that destination may be nothing more than a speck of land surrounded by hundreds of miles of water. Young birds making the trip for the first time manifest the same ability as the older birds for navigating accurately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In a test of a bird’s ability to find its way over unknown territory, some investigators sent a Manx shearwater from England to the United States by plane. There it was released. Within twelve days it was back in its nest on the west coast of England, having flown more than 3,000 miles over an unfamiliar route. Certain types of pigeons manifest a somewhat similar homing ability. When released in unfamiliar territory, they will circle briefly and then head off in the right direction for their lofts.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark22"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark23"></a>Other Navigators</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Like birds, green turtles can also find </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font18">speck of land in the middle of an ocean. Turtles from Brazil swim about 1,400 miles to Ascension Island, a tiny piece of land only seven miles wide in the Atlantic Ocean between South America and Africa. For these turtles to navigate accurately to that tiny island is a remarkable feat. It is believed that they use the same method of navigation as used by migratory birds. But their location-finding ability is possessed by many other inhabitants of the oceans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Eels migrate through the Atlantic Ocean from rivers in Europe and America to their spawning grounds near the Bahama Islands. For many of them this is a trip of thousands of miles. Every year Alaskan fur seals swim 3,000 miles to the Pribilof Islands to give birth to their young, and they too find their destination without difficulty. Salmon swim hundreds of miles through the Pacific Ocean at spawning time to ascend rivers that they left years before as mere fingerlings. With astounding homing ability they return to the very streams where they were hatched. Even insects have an amazing sense of direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Monarch butterflies migrate more than 1,800 miles from eastern Canada to San Luis Potosi in Mexico without getting lost. Bees know the direction in which they found food and are able to communicate that direction to other bees by a peculiar dance in the hive. Foraging ants do not lose their way when they are hundreds of feet from their nests but are able to find their way back. Solitary wasps have no trouble locating their individual nests in the ground although they may have to fly hundreds of yards away to locate a spider or caterpillar to stuff into it. Whether they approach it from the air or from the ground, they are able to find it despite its tiny size and inconspicuous appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">These and many other creatures seem to have a surprisingly good sense of direction. What many of them succeed in doing instinctively man can do only with special instruments. Not until recent years did man begin to realize how some birds, animals, insects and sea creatures are able to travel without getting lost.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark24"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark25"></a>Celestial Navigation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Experiments by researchers have revealed the remarkable fact that the sun, moon and stars are important factors in the direction-finding ability of certain creatures. Early in the 1950’s investigators such as G. V. T. Matthews of England and Gustav Kramer of Germany turned up convincing evidence that pigeons and wild birds orient themselves by means of the sun, using it as a compass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">While working with starlings, Kramer discovered that their direction of flight in a building could be altered by deflecting sunlight through different windows by means of mirrors. He also found that they used the sun to locate a feeding station they had been trained to look for in a particular direction. With their surroundings screened off from them, all they could see was the sky. On sunny days they found the feeding station with no difficulty, but on overcast days they hunted for it at random.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">An experiment performed with warblers by another researcher, E. G. F. Sauer of Switzerland, proved that they can orient themselves not only by the sun but also by the stars. When migration time came, | caged warblers would invariably take up the right direction of flight. The only clue they had as to direction was the night sky They watched it so closely that meteors would cause a momentary change in their direction of flight. Whenever the sky was hidden by clouds they became disoriented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">This was also observed with free warblers while migrating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Regarding the astounding navigational ability of warblers, Sauer states in the magazine </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span><span class="font18"> of August 1958 with regard to a warbler named Johnny: “Johnny’s behavior, confirmed by experiments with other birds, leaves no doubt that the warblers have a remarkable hereditary mechanism for orienting themselves by the stars—a detailed image of the starry configuration of the sky coupled with a precise time sense which relates the heavenly canopy to the geography of the earth at every time and season. At their very first glimpse of the sky the birds automatically know the right direction. Without benefit of previous experience, with no cue except the stars, the birds are able to locate themselves in time and space and to find their way to their destined homes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Accurate navigation requires a means for precise measurement of time. An instrument used by men for this purpose is called a chronometer. It gives a navigator his longitude location on a navigational chart. A sextant gives him his latitude position by measuring the angle of the sun above the horizon at noontime. These instruments make it possible for accurate guidance of a plane or a ship to a distant place. Birds accomplish the same thing without the instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A bird knows from the position of the sun at any time of day which direction to fly. It automatically allows for the movement of the sun across the sky so that its angle of flight does not change. In order to do this it must have an accurate time sense or inner clock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The inner clock of celestially guided creatures appears to be regulated by their bodily processes. The time sense of bees, for example, can be speeded up by increasing their metabolism with drugs, and it can be slowed down by retarding their metabolism. Whatever the inner dock actually is, it is essential for those creatures that travel by the position of heavenly bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Experiments with sockeye salmon have revealed that they too navigate by heavenly bodies. It was found that they have consistent directional tendencies as long as they can see the sky. But when the skies are overcast or artificially covered, the fish point in random directions. Similar results were had in experiments with the little shrimplike crustacean, Talitrus salta-tor, that inhabits the shores of Europe. It always moved in the right direction for reaching the sea when removed a distance from it. Loss of direction occurred only when the sky was heavily overcast. Like the starlings, it responded to mirrored reflections of the sun and altered its course accordingly. A similar response was achieved by mirrored reflections of the moon. It had a time sense that allowed for the movements of the sun and moon so that its path of travel was always correct.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark26"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark27"></a>Insects</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">By means of the sun or polarized light from a patch of blue sky bees are able to navigate their flights from flowers to hive without losing their way. What is even more remarkable is that a returning bee informs other bees in the hive where it has found food. This is done by </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font18"> peculiar dance that reveals the location of the food by indicating its direction according to its angle with the sun. The time of day is taken into account by the bee so that the angle will be correct for other bees that head for the spot. It adjusts its position with the movement of the sun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">An experiment with an aviary placed in a darkened shed revealed the effect of polarized light upon bees. A wide tube that opened on the sky was placed over the entrance of their hive. When a polarized light filter was held over the open end of the tube and turned, the dancing bees at the entrance of the hive turned through the same angle that the filter was turned. It appears that the compound eyes of insects enable them to see polarized light and to use it as a reference for navigation. Polarized light helps ants to find their way about although they depend chiefly upon scent trails that they lay down. Ants that have their view of the sky blocked by a Polaroid light filter can be made to go in different directions by merely rotating the filter. They alter their course according to the polarized light they see coming through the filter. Other insects, such as the wasp, depend upon landmarks such as trees, stones, and so forth.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark28"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark29"></a>Source of Orientation Ability</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">That unreasoning creatures are able to orient themselves by polarized light and heavenly bodies is a cause for wonderment. How did they come to have this ability? Where did night-flying birds such as the warbler learn to navigate great distances by the stars? How did other birds learn how to use the sun? Why is it that young migratory birds automatically know which direction to migrate and how to navigate the trip although it is a new experience for them? Who taught the salmon how to use the stars for finding its way back to the place where it was hatched? How did these creatures get a time sense so they can allow for the movement of the heavenly bodies that they use as a compass? How did bees come to have the ability to use the sun and polarized light for finding their way about? Why are these creatures able to do by instinct what man has had to learn to do with the aid of special instruments?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The obvious answer to these questions is that celestial navigation is beyond the power of nonreasoning creatures to develop by themselves. The ability for it had to be imprinted upon their genetic structure by the One who designed their bodies. Thereby the thinking that he did for them became an inherited instinct. Due to this fact, man, with his power of reason, is able to learn from these dumb creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In wonderment man studies the amazing accomplishments of nonreasoning birds, animals, fish and insects and then devises scientific instruments that enable him to duplicate their feats. His navigational instruments permit him to sail and to fly to distant parts of the earth with the same accuracy exhibited by fish, turtles and birds. By applying the aerodynamic principles evident in the bodies of birds man is able to make aircraft that enable him to fly like them. His duplicating the shape of large sea creatures has resulted in speedy undersea craft with exceptionally good maneuverability. His use of sonar and radar copies the dolphin and the bat that use echo ranging for locating food and avoiding obstacles. And so it is with many other scientific achievements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Wise designing is clearly manifested in all these nonreasoning creatures. Their Creator who gave them instinctive knowledge about celestial navigation and other scientific things is worthy of man’s worship and praise. “How many your works are, O Jehovah! All of them in wisdom you have made. The earth is full of your productions.”—Ps. 104:24.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">sucn as rioting, racial</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font23">I</span><span class="font18">N MOST parts of the world respect for law and order has swiftly eroded in recent years. This lawless drift was well described by H. R. McKinnon, prominent lawyer and member of the police commission of San Francisco, who said: “It requires no great effort to establish that disrespect for law is widespread, is alarming, and is steadily growing worse.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Regularly, reports of public defiance of governmental authority are heard from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. Defiance of the law is not limited to criminals, but is indulged in by ordinary citizens who would not consider themselves lawless. One aspect of this was noted by lawyer McKinnon when he stated: “Lately a new development has begun to appear, namely citizen participation in resistance to arrest. Time and time again a police officer making an arrest finds himself surrounded by a group of bystanders who assist the suspect resisting arrest. In some cases they have taken the suspect away from the officer, sometimes before his identification has been established, thus nullifying the whole process. Sometimes they attack the officer, with intent to inflict grievous harm.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Swelling this defiance of the law, sharp increases have occurred in lawless acts conflicts, revolutions and civil disobedience, where people take the law into their own hands, often resorting to acts of violence to gain what they desire. Frequently crowds at sporting events disagree with decisions of officials and hurl missiles at them or even assault them with fists and other weapons. Also, young students all too often show disrespect for authority by irresponsible acts, some even assaulting the very teachers trying to instruct them to respect the law!</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Another shocking manifestation of disrespect for authority on the part of many “average” citizens has come to the attention of police in the United States recently. A man climbed high up on a Brooklyn Bridge cable and threatened to jump in an apparent suicide attempt. As police were struggling to bring him down safely, the crowd that gathered broke into an organized chant, crying, “Jump! Jump!” In a similar situation a short time before, another young man poised on a hotel ledge was urged by a large crowd to jump, adults mocking him, calling him “chicken” and “yellow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">These are not isolated incidents, but reflect the mounting disregard for established law, order and decency on the part of many who are not considered criminals in the ordinary sense. But the question that needs answering at this point is this: Why have so many become defiant of the law, and what has made ordinary people so callous and disrespectful?</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark30"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark31"></a>Reflection of National Lawlessness</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Those in authority cannot shift their responsibility for conditioning the minds of people for such defiance of the law. It must be said that individual lawlessness is very often a reflection of national and international lawlessness. Just as delinquent fathers and mothers are likely to produce delinquent children, so, too, governments that show disrespect for established law and order share in large measure the responsibility for the lawlessness of their citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">What inspiration for lawful behavior is it when nations fabricate reasons for invading and plundering the territory of their neighbor, killing and maiming thousands of innocents? In World War I about 65,000,000 people were mobilized in the armed forces of the nations involved, and during World War n more than 90,000,000, according to </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">The Encyclopedia Americana. </span><span class="font18">When so many persons are trained to destroy property and lives on a wholesale scale, they are being mentally conditioned to do the same, even though on a lesser scale, when they return from war. Since brute force has been applied to solve problems on the international scale, it is not so difficult for some to reason that the same thing can be applied on an individual scale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">How can governments expect respect for law when they themselves mock it? For instance, in 1899 and 1907 two peace conferences were held in The Hague, Netherlands; the first attended by twenty-six nations and the second by forty-four. Almost all these nations were at war in 1914! In 1928 the Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawed war “as an instrument of national policy,” and it was signed by sixty-two nations. Most of them participated in World War H a few years later! Yet these examples represent just a small fraction of the treaties that have been violated in our generation alone!</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It is against international law for the aircraft of one nation to fly over another nation without its permission. Yet the United States, supposedly a champion of law, flew U-2 aircraft over the Soviet Union repeatedly until one was shot down. They have done this over Cuba also. Thus, international law is violated when it suits a nation’s purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Defiance of international law by nations was noted after the 1963 nuclear test-ban treaty was signed by Russia, Britain and the United States. Commented </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">U.</span><span class="font18"> S. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">News &lt;£ World Report</span><span class="font18"> of August 19, 1963: “Optimism stirred by the pact is tempered somewhat by memories that agreements in the past often were repudiated when they outlasted nations’ interests.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">When laws outlast a nation’s interests, the nation does not hesitate to violate them. It is not difficult, therefore, for individual citizens within nations to feel that they will do the same, that they will obey the law until it outlasts their personal interests. Then they resort to whatever means they feel they can get away with, including violence, when their interests are at stake.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark32"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark33"></a>Other Poor Examples</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Below the national level, local leaders also have contributed to the breakdown of law and order. When the United States Supreme Court ordered schools desegregated, the governor of Alabama defied the court and troops had to be called out to enforce the integration order. In Prince Edward County, Virginia, local officials closed down the schools for five years rather than submit to the law! When governors and other high officials defy the highest law of the land, then lesser persons consciously or unconsciously feel they can do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Adding another voice to the justification of defying the law, though supposedly in support of human rights, was none other than Adlai E. Stevenson, United States representative at the United Nations. He stated that with American students participating “in the great struggle to advance civil and human rights, even a jail sentence is no longer a dishonor but a proud achievement.” Thus, defying the law is made a thing of honor. But who is to say when individuals will do the same over other issues that they may consider right, but that others, perhaps the greater majority, including the law, may consider wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Supreme Court of the United States also ruled against permitting Bible reading and prayers for worship in public schools. But many insist that their schools must have these, and work against the law. Such ones fail to see the great harm they do by their resistance and rebellion against law. Their poor example and disrespect for law waters it down in the eyes of others, especially young ones. What such persons fail to appreciate is that the court does not say Bible reading and prayer are wrong! The court merely states that they should not be forced on children, for some are of different faiths and may object. Actually, religious instruction should be given in the home primarily, and that by the father and mother. Without this, compulsory Bible reading and prayer in school have little effect, as has already proved to be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Religion must also take its share of the blame for lawlessness. In South America, as well as elsewhere, the number of children born out of wedlock is staggering. In some lands more than 70 percent of all births are illegitimate! But the Catholic Church, as well as other denominations, continues to accept at their services couples living immorally, without insisting on proper marriage. How can these people be expected to have respect for civil law concerning marriage when the churches do not? Yes, the responsibility of false religion for setting a bad example toward the law is a heavy one indeed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark34"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark35"></a>Heroes</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Another reason for the lawless nature of many people today was typified by this “wise saying” in a newspaper recently: “Fools make rules; great men break them.” This implies that it is an honorable thing to break the law. And is it not true that many of the past and present leaders of nations ,who are singled out as “great men,&quot; “heroes,” fall into the category of rule-breakers, yes, lawbreakers? Some of the most prominent national “heroes” were and are revolutionaries, those who showed utter disregard for the established law and who organized violent revolutions that took the lives of many, including the innocent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In the United States, George Washington is hailed as the “father of his country.” He was a revolutionary. In Russia, Lenin is revered. He masterminded the Bolshevik revolution. Between 1933 and about 1943 or 1944, who was considered the greatest man in Germany? Hitler! He, too, had revolted against the established order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">What effect does this have on law and order? The masses of ordinary people are led to believe that, since their hero was a revolutionary, or a great conqueror, then strife, violence and disregard for the lives of others is proper under given conditions. But what conditions? What one person considers the proper condition for his rioting, revolution and killing, another may not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In Hitler’s case, his conquests conditioned many of his people to commit heinous crimes. Were all those who carried out such crimes viewed as criminals? By no means! Of such ones, Charles Wighton states in his book </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Heydrich, Hitler's Most Evil Henchman:</span><span class="font18"> “They include lawyers, university professors and intellectuals and, as was stated at Nuremberg, ‘they consisted of a group of well-educated, well-bred men, most of them from devout families.’ The other ranks were drawn partly from the SS but still more from the regular police forces throughout the Third Reich.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Thus, the world trend toward delinquency and anarchy is sparked by the idolizing of men who have made disregard for the law a way of life. It is a preparing of the minds of the young to rise up against their elders in delinquent acts. What their fathers did on a national level they can do on a local or home level when they do not like the established law or procedure. It<sup>1</sup> is sad but true that men of peace are rarely the greatest “heroes&quot; that the rising generation seeks to copy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark36"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark37"></a>God's Laws</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">The basic reason for such defiance of law today is that man has forsaken God’s laws governing human affairs. The result is just as was predicted in the Bible: “There is no truth nor loving-kindness nor knowledge of God in the land. There are the pronouncing of curses and practicing of deception and murdering and stealing and committing of adultery that have broken forth, and acts of bloodshed have touched other acts of bloodshed.&quot; (Hos. 4:1, 2) The apostle Paul foretold that in these last days ‘‘wicked men and impostors will advance from bad to worse.” (2 Tim. 3:13) Jesus Christ also foretold “the increasing of lawlessness&quot; in our time. —Matt. 24:12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Should all of this make you throw up your hands and forget about trying to be lawful? By no means! The one who wants to do what is right in God’s sight will respect law and order and will not permit himself to get sucked into the delinquent ways of lawless ones. He will not allow himself to be duped into thinking that by taking the law into his own hands, by rioting or committing murder, he will help to correct what is bad. Instead, he will seek to obtain justice through the due process of law in whatever country he lives. If this is lacking, then the law-abiding one leaves the matter in God’s hands, confident that He will execute justice in His due time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;">PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">• &quot;Youthful criminality is one of our fastest growing and most serious problems,” according to John Edgar Hoover, director of the FBI. Hoover warned:</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“There is one common denominator in the background of almost all youthful criminals —parental neglect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">He blamed soft law enforcement as next most reprehensible.</span></p>

Soon after this magazine was released, people from all over the world began writing to Portuguese officials regarding the religious persecution in Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font27" style="font-weight:bold;">The Portuguese Embassy in the United States wrote to the Awake! magazine after receiving an avalanche of this mail, and attempted to explain the situation of Jehovah’s witnesses in their country. In keeping with the Embassy’s request, and so that Awake! readers will be informed on the situation, the Embassy's letter is here reproduced in its entirety.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brooklyn, New York 11201</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In connection with the article “Portugal Suppresses Freedom of Worship”, which appeared in the May 22, 1964 issue of your publication—and also in reference to a letter from Mr. Grant Suiter, Secretary and Treasurer of the “WATCH TOWER”—the Embassy is in a position to advise you of the following:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">1. There is indeed religious freedom in Portugal, fully guaranteed by the Constitution, as well as by the Christian traditions of the Portuguese people.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font18">2. The Portuguese authorities have not exerted any reprisals against members of the sect “Jehovah’s Witnesses” although certain measures had to be adopted by the</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">16 June 1964</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">same authorities to curb those activities of the “Jehovah’s Witnesses”, in Portugal, which are in flagrant conflict with the laws of the Country and with the private rights of the citizens, to wit:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">a) The “Jehovah’s Witnesses” in Portugal have been distributing propaganda material, and also preaching such propaganda, advocating disrespect for the National Flag and inciting the people against military duty in the defense of their Country, These two aspects of the propaganda of the “Jehovah’s Witnesses” are not pertinent to Religion or Christianity. They are considered subversive attempts against the security and public laws of the Country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">b) In the course of their propaganda activities through the various residential areas of Lisbon, as well as in other towns, the “Jehovah's Witnesses’’ have violated the privacy of<sup>1</sup> the citizens, by imposing their presence in their homes on false pretences, and forcing propaganda material on them, often with threats and insults. In several instances, these “Jehovah’s Witnesses” have literally forced doors open when the alarmed residents tried to close their doors to protect their privacy. This is a flagrant violation of the rights of privacy of the citizenry in Portugal.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font18">3. The civic and religious groups in Portugal, both Catholic and Protestant, as well as the population itself, became very alarmed in the face of the unethical and seemingly non-religious propaganda and activities of these “Jehovah’s Witnesses”, and the local authorities were flooded with complaints which led to an investigation of such activities and eventually to certain measures to curb them.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font18">It is deplorable, indeed, dear Sir, that the members of the “Jehovah’s Witnesses” should have placed themselves in a position so hostile to Portugal that the genuine alarm of the population and Churches compelled the local authorities to adopt restrictive measures to prevent more disagreeable consequences. Portugal is a deeply Christian country but the Portuguese people also believe in the concept of nationality and in the defense of their Nation’s security, and of the dignity of the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It would appear to us that the missionary activities of all Christian groups should be re-routed towards the anti-Christian countries of the World—of which, unfortunately, there are many—rather than being wasted and creating ill will among peoples, such as the Portuguese, who have followed the precepts of Christ for a thousand years, and who have toiled and died throughout the centuries trying to carry the message of Christ to all comers of the world. We fail to understand this extraordinary paradox in the behavior of the “Jehovah’s Witnesses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In the meantime, allow me, dear Sir, to regret the organized hate campaign which the “Jehovah’s Witnesses” in the United States are carrying on against Portugal, by means of letters addressed to the Embassy. It is a shocking organized campaign by the members of your sect, for we have received many hundreds of letters—the text is often the same in dozens of them, and some even arrive in the wrong envelope! Hastiness, we presume, must have caused the mix-up. But the contents of such unanswerable letters (which are open to your personal inspection) is mainly insulting, coarse, and often bordering on the unprintable. We find it impossible to associate the feelings of the authors of such deplorable letters with the principles of Morality and Christianity, as you, Sir, and I know them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The Embassy would be very obliged to you, if you would kindly have this letter printed in your publication, for this is our clarification in connection with your article about the situation of the “Jehovah’s Witnesses” in Portugal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Sincerely,</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">OPEN LETTER OF REPLY TO THE PORTUGUESE EMBASSY July 6, 1964</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Honorable J. de Menezes Rosa Minister-Counselor Portuguese Embassy Washington, D. C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dear Mr. Minister:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">We are happy to oblige by printing your letter for the consideration of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font18">readers around the world. However, rather than serving to clarify matters, this letter still leaves unanswered the important questions: What is to be done in behalf of those Portuguese citizens who are suffering for their religious beliefs in Portugal? Will Portuguese police continue to hound private citizens, invade their homes, ransack personal belongings and arrest persons simply because they meet together to study the Bible or speak about it to others? Millions of freedom-loving people around the world have their attention focused on the situation in Portugal and they want to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It is obvious to </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> readers that for you to say that “there is indeed religious freedom in Portugal” and that “Portuguese authorities have not exerted any reprisals against . . . ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’ ” is merely to ignore the facts concerning what is happening in your country. </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake! </span><span class="font18">carefully reported facts, names, places, dates and details. For example, the order from the police in Caidas da Rainha forbidding Alexandre Cardosa Veiga, his wife and Jose Fernandes Lourengo to read the Bible is now public knowledge around the world. It has been reproduced in millions of copies of </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Awake!</span><span class="font18"> magazines in many languages. By what standards, or form of reasoning, can a country that refuses its people the right to possess and study the Bible be said to have “religious freedom’’? Do responsible Portuguese officials honestly believe that such action is in keeping with the guarantees of your Constitution? Will similar orders continue to be given?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">That reprisals have not been exerted against Jehovah’s witnesses is simply not true. Bibles, Bible literature and even the furniture have been taken from their homes and, on occasions, never returned. Bible studies have been forcibly broken up, as on August 21, 1963, in Aveiro, and on March 12, 1964, in Lisbon, and those in attendance herded off to jail. In Setubal, Artur Canaveira was arrested, mercilessly beaten by the police, and months later released without any charge being made against him. Down in Angola, Manuel da Silva and Manuel Goncalves Vieira were separated from their families, who depend upon them for support, and were held for months in prison without any charge being made against them. Recently the authorities escorted them to a ship and forced them to travel to Lisbon. How can you say that these are not unjust reprisals against Jehovah’s witnesses? Apparently these are examples of the “certain measures” you said were adopted by the authorities. It is obvious to millions of people who are acquainted with these incidents that they are unjust reprisals, and they will want to know whether Portugal is going to quit this campaign of religious persecution and really grant freedom of worship to Portuguese citizens who are Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">It is common knowledge that Jehovah’s witnesses are not endeavoring to undermine the security of any nation. Their activities are not subversive. They remain separate from politics, as Christ Jesus explained at John 17:14, and confine their activities to preaching the good news of God’s kingdom for which all Christians were taught by Jesus to pray. Therefore, in the vast majority bf countries in the world that grant freedom of religion, Jehovah’s witnesses carry on their preaching without interference. Why is Portugal a major exception? Why is it that you claim that the ministerial activities of Jehovah’s witnesses “are in flagrant conflict with the laws of the Country’’? Is it because Portuguese authorities consider it against their laws to teach people about God’s kingdom? Do they .believe that Jesus’ teaching to “love one another just as I have loved you,” and to “love your enemies,” must be suppressed?—John 15:12 and Matthew 5:44 in the Holy Bible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Contrary to what your letter asserts, Jehovah’s witnesses have never taught disrespect of any nation’s flag, or incited people against military duty. Their internationally distributed Bible textbook &quot;Let </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">God Be True”</span><span class="font18"> clearly says, on page 245; “Jehovah’s witnesses are not against people who salute or desire to salute the flag of any nation. Nor do they oppose the desire of any person to serve in the armed forces of any nation. Nor do they oppose the efforts of any nation to raise an army by conscripting its manpower. If a citizen wants to salute a flag or to enter the armed forces of any nation, it is his right to do so, and Jehovah’s witnesses regard it as wrong for them to oppose the efforts of such person or to condemn him. They do not attempt to convert the world to a refusal to salute flags or to decline to bear arms. They merely keep their neutrality and their obligations as ambassadors for God’s kingdom, and they declare their reasons for refusing to break their allegiance to their God and Savior.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The sole purpose of Jehovah’s witnesses is to make known the teachings of God’s Word the Bible for the salvation of all kinds of people. When individuals learn that God commands men to love one another, regardless of nationality, and as a result they conscientiously refuse to go to war against their fellowman, then what? Did not Justin Martyr and Origen as well as other reputable historians say that many early Christians responded in a similar way to Christ’s message? To contend that they did not is to ignore the facts of history. The prominent religious leader Martin Niembller even said recently: “I cannot imagine Jesus marching with any army,” Was that subversive?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Jehovah’s witnesses endeavor to copy the example of Jesus and his early followers when it comes to the conflicts of worldly nations. Does Portugal consider it a crime for persons to try to imitate Christ? If Jesus and his early followers were alive today, would Portuguese officials imprison and beat them because they refused to quit their preaching work to take up military duty? If not, Portugal should be consistent and refrain from imprisoning and brutally beating modern-day Christians who have conscientious objection to killing their fellowman or training for that purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">While it is true that Jehovah’s witnesses copy Jesus Christ and carry the Christian gospel to the homes of people, they do not ‘violate the privacy of citizens by imposing their presence in their homes on false pretences.’ Neither have they “literally forced doors open when the alarmed residents tried to close their doors to protect their privacy.” That such accusations have no support is evidenced by the fact that no proof of this is given in your letter. These are only slanderous assertions that are made in an attempt to justify Portugal’s unjust treatment of Jehovah’s witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">That Jehovah's witnesses carry on their ministry in the dignified manner that Jesus Christ outlined in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter ten, verses twelve to fourteen, all honest persons who have come in contact with them will testify. Even Catholic priest John O’Brien noted this when commenting on the good that a “tactful, courteous, well trained doorbell apostle” can accomplish. He said: “It is ironic that this apostolic method is now used by nonCatholic sects, especially Jehovah’s witnesses, whose numerous converts put us Catholics to shame.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The conduct of Jehovah’s witnesses is so exemplary that a report concerning it was even incorporated in the United States Congressional Record, 1958, appendix, page A6907. The following excerpts from that Record describe New York city’s estimation of Jehovah’s witnesses following one of their international assemblies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“WITNESSES STYLED CITY’S BEST GUESTS—180,000 AT WORLD ASSEMBLY WIN PRAISE FOR COURTESY, QUIETUDE, AND NEATNESS . . . New Yorkers are unanimous in agreeing that the Witnesses’ conduct has been exemplary, . . . Their cleanliness is now almost legendary. . . . Courtesy has been their watchword.... Executive vice president of the New York Convention and Visitor’s Bureau, called the Witnesses ‘an asset to the community.’ He described their behavior as ‘out of this world,’ ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Does this group of people sound like the kind that would rudely force their way into the homes of people? Of course not! Jehovah’s witnesses simply do not perform their ministry that way. They have a message of peace and they deliver it in a peaceful, courteous manner, in keeping with Jesus’ instructions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You say that the orthodox religious systems in Portugal became very much alarmed because of “the unethical and seemingly non-religious propaganda and activities of these ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses,’ ” and that this “alarm of the population and Churches compelled the local authorities to adopt restrictive measures.” But were not the religious clergy “alarmed” by Jesus’ teaching in the first century also? Indeed they were! The scripture says that when “the chief priests and the scribes heard [what Jesus taught, they] began to seek how to destroy him; for they were in fear of him, for all the crowd was continually being astounded at his teaching.” The chief priests were finally able to silence Jesus’ “alarming” teaching by instigating his death, but their attempts to quiet his followers failed.—Mark 11:18; see also John 19:15 and Acts, chapters 4 through 7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Similarly, in Portugal today the Catholic clergy are resentful and envious when Jehovah’s witnesses call at the homes and people by the thousands respond to their Bible message. It so infuriates some religious leaders that they accuse Jehovah’s witnesses of being subversive, of disseminating “non-religious propaganda”—the same false charge made against Jesus: “This man we found subverting our nation.” (Luke 23:2) But Christ’s message was not subversive, and neither are the teachings of Jehovah’s witnesses today! Those who say they are subversive are spreading lies. Jehovah’s witnesses are a Christian people who are granted freedom of worship throughout the free world. Should they not, then, be allowed to carry on their worship in Portugal also? How can you expect the world to believe that Portugal is a &quot;deeply Christian country” when she suppresses the activity of Christians in the same manner as Communist lands do?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">While the Churches may call the preaching activities of Jehovah’s witnesses “unethical,” at the same time, some Catholic clergymen will admit that this is the way Christianity should be practiced. In your neighboring country Spain, Catholic priest Jesus Urteaga wrote in the magazine Mundo </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Cristiano,</span><span class="font18"> in its September 1963 issue: “If the first Twelve [apostles] would have been as useless as many of us are, the Church of Christ today would be only a small historical remembrance. But they were proselytizers as God commands. Today, Christ asks of all of us more aposto-late and more proselytism. . . . Those that are not proselytizers, are sleeping Christians, useless, empty, insipid and pusillanimous, without salt and without light. In the eyes of God their lives are sterile.” In order to avoid being sterile in the eyes of God, Jehovah’s witnesses preach “publicly and from house to house,” just as did the apostles. (Acts 20:20; 5:40-42) They are preaching from house to house in Portugal without salary, out of Christian love for neighbor, telling other persons about the Almighty God and Christ Jesus and trying to help them to gain the knowledge of God that will lead them to everlasting life. If such works done in Portugal mean that the workers are considered &quot;hostile,” then we are indeed sorry to learn that Portugal is in that position with relationship to the work ordained by the Almighty God through Christ Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You say that missionary activities “should be re-routed towards the antiChristian countries,” for Portugal has “followed the precepts of Christ for a thousand years.” But surely you are not asking all Catholics and Protestants to stop their preaching in Portugal. Then why should Jehovah’s witnesses do so? Jehovah’s witnesses do go to “anti-Christian countries” to preach, but they also must speak to their neighbors in whatever land they happen to be living. They follow the instructions of Jesus Christ, who sent his early disciples first to their fellow countrymen, and then out to other nations. (See Matthew 10:5, 6; Acts 1:8.) As long as there are crimes, violence, immorality, occupied prisons, or suffering in any land—and this seems universal—there is no question about the need for more Christian preaching and teaching. It will result to the benefit of Portugal and her people as Jehovah’s witnesses continue their Christian work in the cities and towns in which they live. There are now thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses in Portugal and, no matter what any human authority says, they feel obligated to obey the Scriptural command to “Preach the word.” (2 Timothy 4:2) Christians do not forget to render to God what belongs to Him. (See Matthew 22: 21.) To obey God’s Word is the Christian thing to do, is it not?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The question is, Will Portugal do the Christian thing? Will she follow the precepts of Christ? Certainly Christ never forbade anybody to read the Bible, or had them thrown into prison for preaching its message! He never jabbed a bayonet in the side of those with whom he did not agree. Nor did he invade the privacy of other peoples’ homes and take away their possessions. But this is what the police have been doing to Jehovah’s witnesses in Portugal. Are these the acts of a “deeply Christian country”? You can be sure that millions of freedom-loving people around the world do not think so. They will be praying to God that Portugal will recognize its mistake and refrain from its program of religious persecution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Contrary to what you say, publishing the facts regarding the suppression of freedom of worship in Portugal is no part of an “organized hate campaign.” It is an effort to bring to the attention of responsible government officials what is actually being done to unpopular religious minorities. Neither is it because of hate that people from all over the world are writing Portuguese officials; rather, it is because of love and concern for Christians Who are suffer* ing for their religious beliefs in your country. You do not tell us what language is from your standpoint “insulting, coarse and often bordering on the unprintable.” But since the Portuguese embassy in Washington would not accept my first letters regarding this matter because they contained the word “persecution,” it is understandable that you probably class any letter referring to such persecution as &quot;insulting, coarse and . . . bordering on the unprintable.” At times it is necessary to speak very frankly when one states truth so his hearers will know exactly what he means. That this is the Christian way is evident from the example of Christ Jesus at Matthew 15:1-20 and chapter 23, which Bible portions please read.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">However, we are sorry if you feel we are in any way rude or unkind. Our purpose is simply to seek justice for a Christian minority in Portugal. Frankly it is disappointing to us not to receive any assurance from you that the authorities will investigate the cases of persecution already reported. We hoped this would be the case when information was called to the attention of the higher authorities. Reports continue to come in showing the need for just action. For example: Here is the report of Maria Emilia Soares da Costa, a Christian woman residing at Castelo Branco, Portugal:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">&quot;On the 12th of May, 1964,1 was visited by a plainclothes policeman and was told to report to the chief of police of Castelo Branco, Joaquim Dias. When I arrived at the police station at 4 o’clock in the afternoon of the same day, another brother, Tomas Gil, was already there, having also been advised to do so. We were taken into the waiting room and were received by a man whom I presumed to be the police chief. He asked, ‘Are these the Jehovahs?’ When he was told that we were, he shouted in a loud voice so that all could hear, Aren’t you ashamed of yourselves? Do you think the police are sleeping? Do you know what happened to Anibal Pires? [A brother who was in Castelo Branco and who lost his job due to police pressure on his boss and who had to leave the city to find employment.] Do you know what happened to ‘Brother’ Nascimento? [A resident in Castelo Branco who was also forced to leave due to police pressure.] You [meaning me] have until the end of the month to leave the city of Castelo Branco. Before leaving, come here and tell us where you are going. You can’t stay here one day extra. If you don’t leave, we will not give you one moment of peace. Your every move will be watched and then you will be put in prison. Do you hear?'</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">“I was then dismissed and the other brother was taken into the office of the chief and told in a more polite manner that we could not have meetings nor go from house to house and that no matter where we went, Covilha, Fundao, etc. [small towns twenty to thirty miles away that are in the same province] we would be arrested.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Further, at Vila Nova de Gaia on the 13th of May, 1964, Colonel Santos Junior, commander of the Public Security Police of Porto, and Antonio Gomes da Silva, member of the same police, entered the Kingdom Hall in Vila Nova de Gaia. The meeting had ended and most of Jehovah’s witnesses had left. The police asked several questions and confiscated a small amount of literature that they found, including seven Bibles. The presiding minister, Joaquim Pereira, was ordered to appear at the local police station the next day. He did so and was questioned for over an hour about the activities of Jehovah's witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">On the 27th of the same month, just as the Theocratic Ministry School was ending, eight policemen entered the Kingdom Hall and demanded all the literature “that talks about Jehovah,” including Bibles. They then took the three members of the congregation committee to the Aljube prison of the Public Security Police. These three witnesses of Jehovah stayed in this prison until two days later, the 29th, at which time they were transferred to the International Police prison. The three were kept in this prison until the 30th, at which time they were again questioned and finally booked on the charge of holding &quot;a criminal and illegal meeting.” Each was made to pay $6.50 and all were released to await trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Jehovah’s witnesses are peace-loving people who have been grossly misrepresented in your country and have, as a result, been the targets of terrible persecution. You can help by letting officials in Portugal know that here in the United States, as in all free countries, Jehovah’s witnesses are granted their freedom and are not considered subversive or a threat to national security.</span></p>

<p><span class="font23">T</span><span class="font18">IE days when slavery blighted this beautiful island have long since passed. The indignities, the horrors of that time make a shameful record in the annals of history. Great forward strides have carried Jamaica from slavery to emancipation to independence. And yet many Jamaicans are not yet free. The obeahmen and evil spirits are their masters; sorcery and superstition, their shackles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Who are these evil spirits and what strange powers do they possess? They are commonly known as “duppies’' and tl^y are believed by the people here to be the spirits of the dead who terrorize the living, doing so on their own initiative, or being prevailed upon, through the media of an obeahman to cause injury to some particular person. Duppies are said to reside in cottonwood trees or in bamboo thickets, remaining close at hand for their nightly prowlings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Safeguards are many.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">By ‘‘Awake!&quot; correspondent in Jamaica</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">Wily as these evil ones may be, Jamaicans believe that they can be tricked by some very simple devices. Many who scoff at the idea of such spirits still observe the precautions, just in case. Here are a few:</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">An open Bible is placed at the head of a newborn baby to keep evil spirits from entering the soft spot and causing the child to be dumb or demented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A mother remains in her room for nine days after giving birth; doors, windows and crevices closed against the entry of duppies. She will not leave the yard for three months. The same customs prevail among all classes, but some may give the reason as fear of catching cold, especially from the night air. Precautions are relaxed only after the child has been christened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A white cloth bound around the head in case of fever or headache, it is said* will attract angels and thus repel duppies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">A cob of corn is fastened over a doorway to forestall the duppy’s entry. He will stop to count the kernels, they say, and, since he can count only to three, he never makes it over the ____ threshold.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>“Nine-Night&quot; and &quot;Forty Days”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Observance of proper rites at a person’s death, they believe, will set the spirit free from its earthly home and reduce the danger of future hauntings. Included in the ritual is the practice of “nine-night.&quot; For eight nights friends and relatives gather at the home of the bereaved family to sing hymns. In many cases, games are played and stories told to cheer up the family. On the ninth night, all relatives, friends and neighbors of the deceased person must be there without fail, for on that night his spirit makes the final check and must be satisfied that due homage has been rendered. Anyone missing may expect trouble from him in the future. Until midnight there is monotonous but vociferous hymn singing, but with the supper and a generous portion of rum, provided by the family of the deceased, the gathering changes tone and pace,' and dancing, singing and drumming continue until dawn. Then the house is swept, possessions of the dead are given to relatives, boiled unsalted rice and rum are thrown out, and, it is said, the spirit recognizes that it is time to go. He is no longer welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Similar to this is the forty-day ritual, usually reserved for a cult leader. This is not only a commemoration celebration but also the occasion for selecting his successor. This time a table or altar will hold something to attract the “spirit of the dead man,” and his favorite hymns will be featured. The program continues until the participants become spirit-possessed.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>'‘Duppy Setting”</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Diseases, major or minor, and misfortune in business or in love are also believed to be the responsibility of the duppies, and this is where the obeahman comes in. On payment of a fee, he will “set a duppy” on any designated victim. In a small bag he may put such objects as pieces of broken glass, chicken bones or feathers, blood-smeared rags, nails and, if possible, a personal possession of the victim. This bag, having had mysterious incantations muttered over it, will be buried in the yard or left near the victim’s home. Imagine, now, the poor fellow, possibly on his way home after a day’s work cutting cane or cultivating yams. He is weary, but quite happy and relaxed because his work is done. But now he spots the bag. What is this? Obeah! Terror grips his heart. Beads of perspiration break out all over him. Trembling, he sinks to the ground, face buried in his hands. “Wha’ fe do?” he groans. All is lost. There is no hope. Death is certain. But stop! “Perhaps there is a way. Find an obeahman!” he reasons. And off he scurries to the same one or another to get relief and vengeance! Now the obeahman, the master, can play one against the other, his fee from both.. The shackles are tight. They are not yet free.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19640822_files/g_E_19640822-14.png" alt="" style="width:98pt;height:179pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font18">The fear of obeah is so great that a person afflicted with a sudden ailment will immediately presume that someone has set a duppy on him. His friends will encourage him “to see to it,” and so instead of getting medical aid, he will seek out an obeahman, who will convince him that he has an enemy and will obligingly concoct a counteracting spell for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The obeahman claims ability to bestow prosperity in business, to help to win your court case and his interference in love affairs can make or break them. If obeah fails, he has the classic comeback. Instructions have not been properly carried out, and these are sufficiently complex to give weight to his claim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The practice of obeah is illegal, but it continues, secretive, mysterious and evil, thriving on the credulity of the peasant, not yet free. Sociologists and historians trace the obeahman back to the African witch doctor, particularly of the Ashanti tribe. Today the obeahman may also be a cult leader and be expected to work good and offset bad. One such cult is called “Pocomania.”</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Pocomania and the Cults</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Pocomania, “Little madness.’’ What an intriguing name for a religion! A visit to a typical meetinghouse should prove most interesting. There are a number of centers in town but the one I have in mind is a little distance away. But come, Jamaican nights are made for walking. The tropic sun has finished with the island for today and the air is clear, balmy and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">holding them in his power and extracting darkness like a velvet cloak.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">You are eyeing those church buildings. Yes, some of them have been there for a long time, at least a long time in relation to Jamaica’s history. Did you know that Columbus dedicated this lovely island to “the Most Holy Trinity”? That was in 1494 and so Jamaica remained a Catholic island until the church was proscribed from 1655 to 1792. In 1662 the Church of England became the established church with the support and under the control of the government. Endowment lasted until 1870. However, keep in mind that in those early days, the church confined its activities to the planters and estate owners. Christianity was not thought suitable for slaves. It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that the teachings of Christendom reached the slave population, and this through the efforts of the nonconformist missionaries. Then “Christian” elements were superimposed on African beliefs, resulting in cults similar to the one we are about to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Today nearly every religion known to Christendom is represented in Jamaica, as well as a Hindu samaj, a Jewish synagogue and a Moslem mosque. Religion of one sort or another is very much a part of the life of the people of this island. Atheism, even skepticism, is almost unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">For some time you have been conscious of the beating of drums. That has been the signal to the community that a service is being held tonight. The churches we have passed would seem to qualify Jamaica for a place on Christendom’s roll call, but what you are about to see is something less orthodox. We just follow this path through to the clearing, and here we are.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Notice the bamboo pole with the shelf over there near the door. The glass of water and the white flowers you see on it are the cult leader’s means of contacting and receiving messages from the spirit world. As usual there are many people here, both inside and outside the meetinghouse. It is not a very imposing structure, but that is not important. Let us look inside. The man in white, wearing the turban, is the leader or “shepherd.” You notice that behind him on the raised platform are pictures of Jesus and some saints, a wooden cross and some flowers. The altar is not on the platform, but down in the wide center aisle. It is simply a table bearing an open Bible and some flowers. The benches nearest it are occupied by a group of women, also wearing white and with their turbans wound high like the leader's. These are his assistants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">The service begins. Prayer, Bible reading, testimony giving and sermon, while emotional and while laboring on the sinfulness of the world, are not too unusual except for the repeated interruptions of the audience. Shouting and groaning to show their approval, they have entered right into the service itself. Then as they sway and clap their hands, the assistants begin moving about the altar, grunting rhythmically. Goaded on by the shepherd, the shuffling gyrations gain momentum and the grunts gain volume. Eyes take on a glassy look. Some are closed. Gradually a trancelike state replaces the frenzy. Glance around at the congregation. Drops of sweat wet every brow. Emotions are tense. Some succumb and fall to the ground. The shepherd’s voice rises above the grunts invoking the spirits to come, the spirit of Jesus, the spirit of Moses and even the spirit of the earth. The white-clad group are overcome. Falling to the ground, they writhe in agony, and the grunting turns to moans and sobs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Back outside, the air seems much cooler in contrast with the heat being generated inside the meeting place. How can they keep going at such a pace? Some do it by smoking ganga, a form of Indian hemp, before the service begins. Thus fortified, they can work up to a frenzy quicker and can continue on for a longer period of time without becoming exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Because they are not yet free from the deep-seated fear of duppies, people flock to these meetings. Many may attend some orthodox church on Sunday, and such meetings during the week. There is a feeling that the ceremonies and rites of the Catholic Church will give further protection against duppies, and so many persons are both Pocomanians and Catholics. Others are reluctant to admit any connection with such cults, claiming they only go to these meetings for fun. When pressed, however, they will acknowledge a fear of duppies and faith in the healing powers of the leader.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>A Magic Bath</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">Healing is performed by a combination of bush remedies and magic. Often a special bath is prescribed. In her book </span><span class="font18" style="font-style:italic;">Personality in Conflict</span><span class="font18"> Madeline Kerr describes the ingredients of such a remedial bath given to one of the field workers of her research group. This list includes such interesting items as 500 Bible leaves, oil of life, oil of Virgin Mary, Knight of Carry away, Must powder and oil of compellance. The bath was blessed with the reading of Psalm 91.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>A Black God</span></h3>
<p><span class="font18">What of those not bound by such shackles? Have they found freedom? Unhappily, many have only exchanged one form of bondage for another. For example, consider those who have become &quot;Rastafari.” Beneath the red, yellow and green flag of Ethiopia, the brotherhood inhabit dwellings of discarded automobile bodies, flattened oil drums, kerosene tins and cardboard and ponder the injustices inflicted on them by the whites who enslaved their grandparents. This is the outgrowth of black nationalism preached by Marcus Garvey at the beginning of the century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In seeming fulfillment of Garvey’s prophecies, Ras Tafari in 1930 became 'Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, and took to himself the titles King of Kings, Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah. To Garvey’s disciples he became the living God and they look to him to liberate them from white oppression and domination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">Throughout the brotherhood, three ideas prevail: Haile Selassie is divine. That God is black, they claim, is upheld by the original Bible, which was grossly altered by that white man, James I of England. Secondly, the black man is superior, and, thirdly, repatriation to Africa is the ultimate goal and divine right. Aside from these tenets, beliefs vary considerably and members range from pacifists to criminals, from people of average intelligence to the mentally deranged. They claim that smoking ganga unites them spiritually with their god and makes them strong and healthy. Evidence is that it leads to lack of self-control and outright violence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">No, they have not yet found freedom. Addiction to such a drug and a doctrine of bitter racialism cannot lead to freedom and happiness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">There are others that have put off the shackles to accept voluntarily a form of worship that brings happiness now and promises of greater blessings in the future. They have become servants of the Most High God, Jehovah. No duppy can throw them into a panic. No obeahman can act the cruel tyrant over them. No racialism can disrupt their harmony. How has this come about? A systematic study of the Bible has enabled them to lay aside their superstitions and geared them to help to loosen the shackles of those not yet free.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">An isolated mountain area of Mexico was badly jolted by an earthquake on July 6, The villages hardest hit were in the mountainous Sierra de Guerrero zone. A town of 4,000 was pulverized. One report reaching Mexico City said that 80 percent of the buildings in Altamirano were damaged. The quake left a death toll of 36, Some 65 persons in five towns were injured. An estimated 150,000 were said to be homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Malawi</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;§&gt; On July 6 Nyasaland became Malawi—Africa’s 37th free country. A 73-year-old British rule came to an end. Some 40,000 people shouted &quot;Ufulu! Ufulu!&quot; (“Freedom! Freedom!’’) Malawi has a population of 3,900,000, only 8,000 of whom are of the white race. The name Malawi means a land of &quot;flaming waters.” It describes how the gleam of the sun reflects in flaming red off the waters of Lake Nyasa. Dr. H. Kamuzu Banda, the American-educated physician, is Malawi’s first prime minister.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Court Victory</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&amp; On June 20 the Georgia Court of Appeals in the United States ruled that the City of Atlanta had no right to deny Jehovah’s witnesses a permit to build a Kingdom Hall on West Wieuca Road N.W. In 1948 the Peachtree Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses purchased two lots on Juniper Street N.E. and applied for a special use permit, which was denied; in 1950 they were denied a permit for property on Gordon Street S.W.; in 1959 they were granted a permit on Moore’s Mill Road N.W., but after construction was started the permit was revoked. The present lot was purchased in May 1960 and the permit application was filed in June 1961. Some contended that the Kingdom Hall would create a traffic hazard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Court, in an opinion written by judge Homer C. Eberhardt, cited an affidavit by. an attorney for the applicants that showed that thirteen of the twenty-six permits granted under the ordinance governing special use permits involved parking lots smaller than the 1.09 acres owned by the Peachtree Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. The judge noted that, according to figures presented the court, the traffic increase would be only .008 percent three days out of the week. Obviously the objections had little basis in fact. The Court of Appeals, in reversing a Fulton Superior Court ruling, said: &quot;The applicants, having met all of the objective standards of the zoning ordinance pertaining to special use permits, the Superior Court is directed to sustain their application for certiorari and make a final decision in &quot;their behalf.” The proposed Kingdom Hall will seat some 150. persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Inaction Punishable</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; In Italy, France and other European countries, a citizen who witnesses a fellowman in mortal danger and does nothing about it can be punished by law. Four men in Treviso, Italy, were charged on July 3 with &quot;omission of aid&quot; for not helping a drunken workman who had fallen off his bicycle into a canal, in France indifference to the danger of others is punishable by fines and imprisonment. Incidents of citizen inaction and indifference to another's danger such as recently witnessed in New York City would have been punishable crimes in many European countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Mexico’s President-Elect</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Some 11 million citizens of Mexico went to the polls in July. When the votes were counted, they showed that a 53-year-old lawyer from the state of Puebla named Gustavo Diaz Ordaz had been chosen to lead Mexico for the next six years. Some 90 percent of the votes went to him. Presidentelect Ordaz is a practicing Roman Catholic. On December 1 he will take over the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">State Religion’s Effect</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Church historian Dr. Franklin H. Littell has stated that wherever and whenever government has tried to foster religious belief the net result has been to drive people away from religion and not into religion. A report from Salinas, California, June 6, quotes Littell and says’. “Surveys tadl-cate that only 16 per cent of the men and women of France </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">keep the </span><span class="font17">minimum requirements of the Catholic Church for avoiding automatic excommunication: one confession and one communion a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">“In Italy, a survey authorized by the cardinal archbishop of Milan showed only 11 per cent of Italian men performing the same minimal exercises. In the Protestant north, the case is no better. Of the people of Sweden, 98 per cent are reckoned as communicants of the Lutheran state church; the situation in Denmark is roughly the same. Behind the facade, however, official surveys show that only 3.6 per cent of the Swedes and 3.4 per cent of the Danes are actually in effective relationship with the state churches to which they theoretically belong.’’ In actuality, the people are withdrawing their active support from the religious systems that have for so long exploited them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Sam’s Money Problems</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">So that the United States government can pay all its bills during the fiscal year that started July 1, a new temporary $324,000,000,000 debt limit was signed by President Johnson. This represents a rise of $9,000,000,000. And it is the eleventh time in nine years </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">that </span><span class="font17">the temporary ceiling has </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">been </span><span class="font17">raised. The permanent debt ceiling is $285,000,000,000, but the public debt long ago soared past that figure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There was also concern in Washington that consumers are outspending themselves. New installment credit in the month of May hit an annual rate of $66,600,000,000, an alltime high. Installment debt at the end of May stood at $55,-100,000,000—up $5,600,000,000 in a year. Economists are asking, How far will it go before there is real trouble?</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Lost Foothold In Africa</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;$&gt; The Christian Century</span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;"> for </span><span class="font17">March 4, 1964, acknowledged: “There is much in Africa to swing the religious pendulum away from the Christian orbit. We have not practiced toward the African what we have preached to him.” The periodical goes on to say: &quot;After he had retired, one American missionary who had spent half of his life in Africa confessed with great contrition that in all those years no African had ever been permitted to come to his front door; he had neglected to leave his prejudices behind him in Texas.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font17"># European unity is being threatened by a resurgence of nationalism in Europe, so warned twenty top European economic and political leaders at a meeting of the unofficial Committee on Christian Responsibility for European Cooperation, in Switzerland. It warned against “the tendency to have recourse to national interests as the criteria of what is good and bad in international relations.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Satan’s Vandals</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&amp; A secret fraternity, called the “Covenant of the 73rd Demon,” located in America's state of Oklahoma, ran into trouble with the police on June 24, Teen-age devotees professed devotion to Satan the Devil. To prove their loyalty to Satan the youths vandalized local churches. Vandalism was a part of the group’s ritual, police said, by means of which the teen-agers “released their souls to the prince of darkness.” The incidents called for ripping up Bibles, spilling baptismal water, turning crosses upside down. One report stated that animal sacrifices were also included in the fraternity's ritual and that the boys were planning to exhume a human body.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font17">North America </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">not many </span><span class="font17">people go desperately hungry; few, if any, die of starvation. Elsewhere in the world, however, more than 1,500,000,000 go to bed hungry every night. A statistical study by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">(FAO) </span><span class="font17">confirms that at least </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font17">third to a half of the world’s people suffer from hunger or malnutrition. The FAO estimates that only about one-sixth of the world's population is well fed. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">The Royal Bank of Canada Monthly Letter,</span><span class="font17"> June 1964, stated: &quot;The fact is that not more than one in a hundred of the people in underdeveloped countries will ever, in all his life, have what a North American family would consider a good, square meal.&quot;</span></p>

Property damage ran into the millions of dollars. The Philippine Red Cross said some 376,000 persons were made homeless by the winds and the heavy rains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">In west Japan torrential rains soaked the land, causing floods that resulted in the death of at least five persons; some 3,000 were reported homeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">The Vatican Bows</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Roman Catholicism suffered a severe setback in Tunisia. On July 9 the Vatican announced that it had surrendered most of its property in Tunisia, without &quot;material compensation.” It is believed that in an agreement between the &quot;Holy See” and Tunisian authorities, the Vatican agreed to close 104 of its 109 churches in Tunisia in exchange for pledges of religious freedom for Roman Catholics in that land. The monumental St. Louis Cathedral In Carthage, near Tunis, Is one of the Roman Catholic churches to close Its doors under the new agreement. The estimated number of Roman Catholics in Tunisia Is said to be 45,000. The agreement leaves about one Roman Catholic church to care for an average of 9,000 Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font15" style="font-weight:bold;">Father Knows Best</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$• The Canadian conference on the family in June gave fathers who rule with authority a healthy pat on the back. Dr. Nathan B. Epstein, psychia-trlst-in-chief at the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, told delegates at the conference that democracy in families is a modern myth. &quot;Somebody has to make the decisions, preferably the father,” he said. Mrs. E. Davie Fulton, vicepresident of the conference, asserted that &quot;the trials and tribulations of modem families arise because modern social arrangements have stripped the family of Its traditional functions and patterns of authority.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Enforcing Rights Law</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; The Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law In America on July 2. Two hours and 10 minutes after the bill was signed it received Its first major test. The United States District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, was asked by the Heart of Atlanta Motel Corporation to enjoin Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy from enforcing the public-accommodations section of the law. The Atlanta motel corporation asked $11 million in damages, stating that the desegregation requirements of the law would ruin his business, reputation and goodwill. The case is now up for a hearing. In Jackson, Mississippi, the Robert E. Lee, the third-largest hotel in the city, closed rather than accept Negro guests In compliance with the civil rights act But for the most part the view prevailed that, since it is a 'matter of law, the law would be complied with. Segregation ended peacefully at a number of swimming pools, eating houses, motels and leading hotels. However, others have kept Negroes out with pistols and clubs. A wave of civil rights workers have been pouring into the South to have part in making the terms of the law a reality in the life of the people.</span></p>

<p><span class="font18">In the contest for world rulership many nations and empires have come and gone. But has it ever occurred to you that man’s first government was in no way a pattern for them?</span></p>
<p><span class="font18">In the garden of Eden, God ruled mankind from heaven. And even after Adam sinned and was expelled from Eden he did not set up a kingdom of men ruling men. The modern-day pattern was not established until centuries later, shortly after the Flood, and then it was begun by an enemy of God. What will the final outcome be? Will God allow men to continue indefinitely following a system he did not authorize or will he return to his own established pattern for world government? How does the answer to these questions affect us in this generation?</span></p>
