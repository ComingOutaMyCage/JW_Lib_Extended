<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Volume XL1V &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London, England, November 22, 1963 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 22</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font0">T HAS been meaningfully said that indecision is the thief of time and procrastination is .its best accomplice. Much more could be accomplished by communities and by individuals if persons could do away with putting off until tomorrow what might just as well be done today. If you procrastinate you may not only be thieving valuable time—you may also be losing out on much of the enjoyment to be had from life by putting more into it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of course, we know you cannot do everything you might want to do each day. None of us can. But did you know that output and production in numerous fields have simply boomed through the employment of better planning and improved work methods—with no additional effort? You and your family can easily apply the basic principles of production increase. To a large extent they attack the thief's accomplice, procrastination. It has to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Webster’s</span><span class="font0"> dictionary tells us that to procrastinate means “to put off intentionally and usually habitually and for a reason held to be reprehensible (as laziness, indifference to responsibility).” You may not have thought of the habit of putting off as being quite that censurable. Of course, there are times when deferring things may be wise and beneficial, but why not face it? You may be wearing yourself out as you lean back in an armchair, wondering, “Should I or should I not?” When you know you should, why not do it? You will feel much better if you reserve your well-earned relaxation until it can be fully enjoyed with the exhilarating feeling of duty accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, aside from your own personal satisfaction, there are other more important reasons why something has to be done about procrastination. Time is running out fast in this old world, and there is yet room for beneficial things to be done if someone—like you, for instance—will just do them. You may be a person who has found a way to be of real service to your neighbor by wise use of this elusive thing that others may call “spare time.” If you know how to do good, then there is every reason for you to strive to get the most out of each minute of the day. You may recall the words of Jesus’ disciple James: “If one knows how to do what is right and yet does not do it, it is a sin for him.” (Jas. 4:17) Might not procrastination lead one into committing this sin? If you are aware of a friend who is pursuing a course that can lead him headlong to his doom, does your conscience allow you to procrastinate in doing your utmost to change his course? In these times, putting off until tomorrow can be just that serious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A fellow disciple of James wrote about diligence in the exercise of Christian love and added: “Do this, too, because you people know the season, that it is already the hour for you to awake from sleep.’* Why? “For now our salvation is nearer than at the time when we became believers.” (Rom. 13:11) And that was nineteen hundred years ago! It makes you think, does it not? This writer was the vigorous, energetic, time-conscious apostle Paul. Did he do anything to help people other than write letters about the situation? Listen: “Therefore keep awake, and bear in mind that for three years, night and day, I did not quit admonishing each one with tears.” A procrastinator? Not Paul!—Acts 20:31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did you ever hear of buying out time? It can be bought, not with money, but probably at the cost of other pleasurable interests. Your Bible tells you about it in Ephesians 5:15-17. Here the inspired writer Paul explains how time can be bought, and you will notice that part of the process involves ‘keeping strict watch’ on how we walk. Have you ever tried that? Use your diary for a few days to watch closely how you use your time. You may be surprised to find how much time you spend doing &quot;nothing.” And, yet, if you take stock of your achievements you may also wonder why so many details have had to be left uncared for because you did not have enough time. But didn’t you?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The scripture we just suggested reading also tells us to “cease becoming unreasonable.’’ Now, you may feel that you are only being reasonable with yourself as you take time out for relaxation, even at the sacrifice of things you know down deep should be handled. But are you sure you are not rationalizing? You know, being reasonable with yourself can be confused with being self-sparing. Some persons are religiously methodical in their use of time for personal pursuits, pleasure, theatergoing and hobbies. Nothing must interfere with these things; there is no thought of putting them off until tomorrow. Many of these pursuits may not be wrong, and, to some extent, they may even be necessary, yet they are not the really important things in life. Indulged in to a reasonable degree, they can be beneficial; over indulgence can be disastrous. Does one just </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">have</span><span class="font0"> to spend so much time on that chinning bar, watching TV, or reading a novel? The honest answer is, probably, No. Is there essential reading waiting to be caught up with or are there appointments to be kept? The truthful answer is, probably, Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remember, to procrastinate can be dangerous. It is really taking chances. Is it truly wise for a car owner who knows that his brakes are failing to put off fixing them until he can “find enough time”? Will tomorrow be soon enough?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Did we hear you say </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“manana”?</span><span class="font0"> The old Spanish word has come to be used internationally because of the old Spanish custom it implies. But the truth is that tomorrow—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manana, domani, lendemain, </span><span class="font0">or whatever language you say it in—now more than ever may never come for many people. You have good intentions? Fine. You know how to be of service to your friends, your family and yourself? Better still; but do not put it off. To procrastinate is just a waste of time. You know it is. And it has cost lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font0">ITHIN recent months the return to the United States of several Americans who had defected to the Communist side during the Korean War focused attention on the process that led to their defection in the first place. They were among the twenty-one Americans who had originally chosen to remain behind and live in Communist China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not only twenty-one, but many other soldiers had compromised in varying degrees. When the Korean War ended, Western military authorities were positively shocked and horrified by the number of American soldiers who had defected from the standards of behavior expected of them while they were in Communist prison camps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After these prisoners returned, the pieces of what had happened were fitted together. What emerged was a clear picture of the indoctrination program used on prisoners by the Chinese Communists. The term “brainwashing” is used to describe this process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chinese program in Korea was successful in undermining morale to the extent that about one out of three American prisoners collaborated with their captors in one way or another. Some broadcast Communist propaganda. A number of air force officers accused their own country of germ warfare. Others informed against their fellow prisoners. Then there were the twenty-one who accepted communism to the point where they refused repatriation and went to live in China. Lesser compromises included such things as signing Communist peace pledges. Many even gave up the fight to survive altogether and quickly died without any apparent physical cause.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h3><a name="bookmark17"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark18"></a>Mental Pressure</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Scientific experiments reveal the absolute necessity of the mind’s taking in proper impressions from the senses, such as the senses of hearing, sight and touch. Without this, the brain ceases to function in an adequate way and abnormalities of behavior develop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Communist technique took advantage of this fact. No actual physical torture was used, but the more effective mental pressure was employed. The monotonous life in the camps was combined with periods of isolation, deprival of sleep and constant interrogation. Under this combination of circumstances, designed to reduce the mind to a state of helpless misery, the individual’s thinking started to break down, even to the point of his having hallucinations. In such a muddled state of mind, truth was confused with falsehood, and many prisoners produced almost any statement in order to satisfy their captors and escape this mental pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the prisoner began to produce what was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">demanded of him, the</span><span class="font0"> interrogators began to show kindness, supplying the victim with more food, better living conditions and other privileges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A significant finding was that when some were kept in confinement without trial and without hope, they became profoundly depressed after a few months. Life ceased to have significance for many who had every relationship that gave their life meaning taken away from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The entire process of thought reform touched on the two most basic fears in man: the fear of annihilation and the fear of being totally abandoned.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark19"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark20"></a>What</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Was </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Missing?</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Those with strong convictions had been better able to withstand the brainwashing technique. Those without such convictions were easier prey. Since they did not have strong moral or religious roots, many of these did not risk losing their comforts to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stand up for what was right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was also noted that a great number of prisoners were self-seeking, interested only in their own lives and not in the lives of others. They became strangers to one another, unloving and untrusting, yes, isolated even as they were submerged in the mass. The attitude all too prevalent was “you take care of you, I'll take care of me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That such compromises and selfishness could exist in the prison camps should not surprise anyone who has kept up with the times. One who has been alert to the news of recent years can readily see the reason for such a wholesale breakdown of moral values.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a child sees his father cheating on his income tax, the child will not think it too wrong to cheat when he takes examinations at school, especially since others do it too. Later, when he enters the world of business, he is confronted with “dog-eat-dog” tactics, competition for business and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">profits, padded expense accounts, the </span><span class="font0">struggle for jobs regardless of the tactics required to obtain them, the dishonesty, lying, stealing and crime of the times, even in high places. Without any firm moral background or strong religious conviction, he may feel that he must adopt any tactic that will assure his security. Yes, during his lifetime in a world where selfishness has gone to seed, he is actually being brainwashed to feel that in life anything goes that one can get away with.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition, many are spared hard work in their youth because of living in a time of plenty. Pampering parents have not required them to carry their own load while young, so in a time of serious mental struggle they fail. Their minds have not been conditioned to work hard and honestly, so they do not have the stamina to undergo privations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With this background common to so many, we can see why the prisoner would not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stand</span><span class="font0"> up for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">what he is not sure is </span><span class="font0">right, when that standing up could cost him his comfort, freedom from fear, better food and relief from tremendous mental bombardment.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark21"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark22"></a>Where to Turn</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">It is true that an individual cannot change the entire society that breeds this kind of compromising mentality. But the individual, while he will not change society, can change himself and can fortify his mind with what is needed to keep strong when put under severe mental pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mental fortification necessary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comes from the only source in the</span><span class="font0"> universe that can completely overcome these devilish tactics. That Source is God. The Almighty God, who had the power to create the amazing visible universe, has the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">power to assist lowly man. God created </span><span class="font0">man in the first place; he can surely sustain him if he chooses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How does this fortification from God come? Is it automatic? Does a person just need to wait until he is in extreme circumstances and then pray for help? No, a person must begin to fortify himself before the time of stress comes. The athlete does not wait until the contest begins before conditioning himself. The mind must also be prepared before mental pressures are brought to bear against it. What do we use to do this? Jesus Christ gave the answer. when he said: “Your word is truth.” (John 17:17) He recognized that God’s Word, composed and compiled in written form in the Bible, is the source of truth that will fortify the mind with proper material to enable it to withstand any pressure brought against it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By studying the purposes and requirements of God, we will build a mind that will stand like a tower of strength in time of stress. The Christian apostle Paul saw the need of doing this when he encouraged: “Quit being fashioned after this system of things, but be transformed by making your mind over, that you may prove to yourselves the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” (Rom. 12:2) Those who have been making their minds over by taking in God’s thoughts will be in tune with him and will have the moral strength of conviction to resist pressure. Those who have not been making their minds over in this manner, but, instead, are fashioning themselves after this corrupt system of things, will leave themselves open to becoming victims of brainwashing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to building moral and mental strength, there is another essential benefit that comes from studying God’s Word. One who seeks to learn of God and makes </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">his mind over to God’s </span><span class="font0">way of thinking will </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">please </span><span class="font0">God. When he pleases God, he becomes acceptable in God’s sight and God now works in his behalf, answering prayers that are in harmony with his will. Thus, even </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font0">isolation, God will help one with something he would not have had before, and that is God’s holy spirit, his dynamic energy. This active force will operate on the individual and impart strength that would otherwise not be present. No interrogator can break down God’s spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Has God’s Word and the backing of his spirit proved effective in thwarting brainwashing efforts? Yes. Thousands of Jehovah’s witnesses who have emerged from Nazi and Communist concentration camps can testify to this. They have stood the test and amazed their captors. Even death did not deter them, as they had the sure hope of coming back to life on a paradise earth by means of the resurrection from the dead, as Jesus promised.—John 5:28, 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of these Christians who emerged from years of confinement in Communist prisons stated this: “There are no guns, no walls, no prison bars that can keep the spirit of God from reaching his people! If we have applied ourselves to a study of his Word and allowed it to sink down deep into our hearts, there is nothing to fear.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The answer to brainwashing is definite. God’s Word will supply </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0">fortification needed. His spirit supplies additional strength in time of severe crisis. By your taking in the life-sustaining truths contained in the Bible and then using them, your thinking will never be clouded under pressure, for, as the apostle Paul observed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">you will be </span><span class="font0">among those “who through use have their perceptive powers trained to distinguish both right and wrong.” —Heb. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">5:14.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">WASTE DISPOSAL </span><span class="font20" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">—A Growing Problem</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">S</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">urprised</span><span class="font0"> householders who get a glassful of detergent foam from a water faucet instead of good drinking water are made uncomfortably aware of a serious problem in our modem age—how to dispose of a steadily increasing volume of wastes without polluting the water supply. Whether a person lives in a farmhouse, a small town or a sprawling city, he should know something about waste disposal, because it directly affects the purity of his water and the health of his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the nineteenth century when people were ignorant about safe disposal of sewage and the health hazards of polluted water, the city of London dumped untreated sewage into the Thames River, from which the people drew their drinking water. It is not surprising, therefore, that they suffered from repeated epidemics of cholera that killed thousands of people. Although it is still the custom for cities to pour their wastes into rivers from which they draw their drinking water, cholera epidemics are seldom experienced in the world. This is due to the purifying treatment that the wastes pass through before they are discharged into the receiving river and to the purifying treatment that is given river water before it is used for drinking. Despite such sewage treatment, however, pollution problems are steadily increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many countries drinking water is so polluted that it is unsafe to use unless it is first boiled. The pollution of streams, rivers and offshore waters near coastal cities is destroying fish, shellfish and other water life. It also is rendering many bathing beaches unusable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Canada a sudden outbreak of polio in the city of Edmonton was attributed to sewage pollution of drinking water. In the Soviet Union the polluting of rivers by wastes is damaging the Russian fishing industry to the extent of about a quarter of a billion dollars a year. There is grave concern in the United States over the pollution of the nation’s water supplies and the destruction of its fish. There are about 100 million Americans drawing drinking water from rivers and streams into which 120 million people dump their wastes. The mass of sewage is becoming so great that the margin of safety in the natural ability of rivers and streams to purify themselves is becoming dangerously narrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What further complicates the problem is the development of approximately 10,000 new chemical compounds every year that ultimately appear in the wastes that are dumped on the soil or in rivers. Preventing these chemicals from getting into drinking water is not an easy matter, as is evident from the frequency that detergents foam out of household water taps. Aside from this is the danger of radioactive pollution of water from atomic wastes. These come from thousands of institutions that are using radioactive isotopes, as well as from bomb factories and atomic power plants. Wherever they are dumped, into the oceans or into deep holes in the ground, there is always a possibility of their contaminating human food or water supplies. Their safe disposal has become a serious problem.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark23"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark24"></a>Recycling of Water</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The thought of water being recycled or reused by cities located on a river may, to some people, be most unpleasant. But experience has proved that proper treatment of sewage along with the natural purifying ability of a flowing river can make recycling of water a safe practice. When this becomes dangerous is when growing cities come too close to one another so that there is insufficient distance between the sewage disposal pipe of one city and the water intake pipe of a downstream city or when the amount of sewage is so great that it exceeds the ability of the river to purify itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some municipalities find that sewage treatment by sedimentation is sufficient if they have plenty of swift-moving river water that is well oxygenated. Before pouring sewage into the river they pass it through a large tank where the solids are permitted to settle to the bottom of the tank. The effluent, or outflow of liquid wastes, is quickly diluted as it is discharged into the fast-moving water of the river. Bacteria in the river feed upon the small organic matter suspended in the sewage, causing it to break down. This is known as aerobic decomposition. For it to take place there must be ample oxygen in the water, which is not possible when the flow of sewage is excessive. The process is free from odor and maintains a reasonably clean condition in the river so that plants and fish are not destroyed. Disease-causing organisms gradually die. The polluting substances are either destroyed or converted into simple constituents that are normal to clean streams and rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are several processes through which sewage can be passed in treatment plants that produce effluents that vary in purity. It is possible to treat sewage so that the outflow from the treatment plant is of the same quality as that of a normal river.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark25"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark26"></a>Primary Treatment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The primary treatment of sewage begins when it passes through racks or screens of steel bars that are set from one to two inches apart. These protect sewage pumps in a plant from trash that could damage them. Revolving cutters that grind up the trash are frequently used in place of the screens. Preceding the cutters is a widened channel where the rate of flow slows a bit to permit heavy inorganic </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ma</span><span class="font0">terials such as sand to settle out. This is called a grit chamber. The sewage now goes into a sedimentation tank that might be from eight to ten feet deep, where much of the solid material in the sewage drops to the bottom of the tank. The time required for it to pass through this tank may vary from thirty minutes to three hours. Approximately 40 to 55 percent of the solids settle out. If chemicals are added to the sewage to cause coagulation practically all the settleable solids will be removed, but that increases the cost of treatment. Scum that floats on the surface must be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sometimes a special tank is used for skimming grease, oil and other matter from the sewage. Compressed air is blown into the sewage, causing much suspended matter to be lifted to the surface of the tank, where it is skimmed off and disposed of by being either buried or burned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Activated-sludge plant using mechanical aeration</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<h3><a name="bookmark27"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark28"></a>Filters</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">An additional processing step, known as secondary treatment, that many municipalities use is to pass the fluid coming from a sedimentation tank through a filter. Usually this will be what is called a trickling filter. The filter does little or no straining of the fluid but serves to put oxygen into it and to provide surfaces where oxidizing bacteria can live. It consists of broken stone or slag that is laid in a bed that usually is from five to six feet deep. Sewage that is sprayed on this stone trickles down to a system of underdrains at the bottom. The film of bacteria built up on the many surfaces of the stones stabilizes the organic matter by oxidation, changing it to inoffensive compounds including nitrates and sulfates. Since this filter does little straining but principally changes the nature of the suspended matter, the fluid from the filter must be passed into a sedimentation tank, where much of the floating material is removed. The processed fluid can then be discharged into a river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some plants the effluent is given a final treatment by being passed through a sand filter. This filter brings the sewage into contact with more bacteria, which have an excellent purifying action. When a sand filter is used following previous biological treatment, the resulting effluent is hardly distinguishable in appearance from drinking water.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark29"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark30"></a>Activated Sludge</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The solids that settle to the bottom of settling tanks are referred to as sludge. As they settle, mechanical scrapers remove them. Usually the sludge is pumped to a heated digestion tank, where bacteria convert it to a relatively stable mineralized form that is without odor. The gas produced by the process of decomposition is used to heat the digester tank and sometimes serves as fuel for the engines that operate blowers, compressors and pumps. Processed sludge frequently is used by farmers and gardeners as fertilizer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The use of activated sludge in processing sewage is favored by large cities. The effluent from sedimentation tanks is passed into aeration tanks, where sludge with a rich culture of bacteria is added to it. The mixture of sewage and biologically activated sludge is aerated either by mechanical agitation or by pumping compressed air into the tank. The aerobic bacteria flourish and decompose the sewage. After a treatment that lasts from four to eight hours, the sewage passes to final settling tanks, where the activated sludge drops to the bottom of the tank and is removed. Some of it is returned to the aeration tank to be mixed with incoming sewage. The effluent that flows out of the final settling tanks is clear and ready for discharge into a river or stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Detergents have caused problems at sewage treatment plants because they create thick layers of foam over the tanks, tend to prevent solids from settling out of solution and resist the action of bacteria. Consequently some detergent passes through treatment plants into the receiving river and eventually shows up, at times, in drinking water. Recently a new type of sewage treatment was developed that appears capable of removing detergents from sewage.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark31"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark32"></a>Privies and Septic Tanks</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">People living in rural areas are faced with the problem of waste disposal without the aid of central sewage treatment plants. The manner in which they dispose of their wastes is directly related to their health. If care is not exercised, drinking water can be contaminated with infectious agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fever, dysentery and cholera. If untreated human wastes are dumped on the surface of the ground, surface water is contaminated and there is danger from fly-borne diseases, parasitic tapeworms and hookworms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A simple pit privy is a safe method of handling human wastes in rural homes that are without running water. With a suitable covering over the pit flies will not have access to the wastes. It has been found that pollution from the wastes in the pit do not penetrate very far into the soil. The downward travel of typhoid and dysentery bacilli in porous soils is limited to two feet and in denser soils to one foot. They have very little horizontal movement into the soil. Intestinal bacteria have a horizontal movement of only about one foot, whereas their downward movement is up to five feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a protection to underground water that supplies wells with drinking water, a privy should not be dug so deep as to penetrate the water table. If that is done the privy will pollute the water supplying the nearby wells. The pit should terminate at least five feet above the water table. In the case of cesspools, they should terminate at least ten feet above it. A privy should not be dug where there is limestone or fissured rock. Pollution from the privy can easily seep great distances through their crevices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font0">privy, cesspool or septic tank should, if possible, be located downhill from a well. In any event they should be at least 50 to 100 feet away, especially if groundwater rises into a privy during rainy periods. Depending upon the number of persons using a pit privy, it should serve for ten years or more when no garbage is thrown into it. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Lime </span><span class="font0">can be used to help control odors, but disinfectants should never be used, as they will destroy the bacteria that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font0">necessary for decomposing the wastes. In the event that water should get into the pit, a cupful of kerosene poured into it at weekly intervals will discourage the breeding of mosquitoes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cesspools have disadvantages that cause many health authorities not to recommend them. The pores in the soil around the cesspool can, in the course of time, become choked up. This can cause it to overflow, creating an unhealthy situation. There </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font0">less likelihood of this when the cesspool is used in conjunction with a septic tank, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font0">ceiving only the effluent from the tank. In both the cesspool and the septic tank anaerobic bacteria decompose the solid matter and change its nature. Most diseasecausing organisms are destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is unwise to discharge the effluent from a septic tank into an open ditch, as it still contains a large amount of solids and great numbers of bacteria. Running the outflow from the tank through buried clay pipes with open joints is a safer method of disposal. The effluent can then seep into the soil. By the time the liquid reaches the underground water table it will have been purified by its passage through the ground. A septic tank requires a porous soil. Heavy clay soils are unsatisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since human wastes can spread healthdestroying diseases, parasites and death, it is imperative that they be disposed of in a safe manner. No person can afford to ignore this. The problem of waste disposal is an extremely important one and must be solved in a safe manner no matter where a person may live. Growing population and industries have caused waste disposal to become a thing of major concern to health authorities and conservationists. The use of wise sewage treatment in cities and rural areas is an important factor in making certain that sickness and possibly death do not lurk in our water supply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font12" style="font-weight:bold;">DO YOU KNOW HOW TO</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">L</span><span class="font0">OSS of employment can be a severe blow to a man and his family, especially when they have many monthly bills to pay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It can cause a great amount of anxiety. Whether you have had the experience of losing a job or not, it is wise to know what can be done to avoid being fired or being among those that an employer lets go when he finds it necessary to reduce his payroll. There are certain things you can do that will help you to hold your job or at least to keep employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some countries there are employers who, when reducing the number of their employees, will follow a seniority arrangement. Disregarding a man’s ability and diligence, they will keep him on the payroll or let him go on the basis of the number of years he has been working for the company. There are other employers, however, who base their decision upon the man’s value as an employee. With technical advances wiping out approximately 35,000 jobs every week in the United States alone, a man should give some thought as to how he can increase his value to his employer or how he can develop ability in another industry in case automation eliminates his job or the business he is in suffers a severe economic setback.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the best assurances of steady employment is for a man to upgrade himself by developing a new marketable skill or by improving the one he has. If he decides to develop a new skill, he should first investigate to find out what skills are in demand and what training courses are available. Rather than waiting until he is unemployed before he begins such job training,</span></p>

<h3><a name="bookmark33"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark34"></a>Self-Examination</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">There is great value in taking stock of yourself from time to time to see how you can strengthen your hold on your job. Perhaps you have developed habits that are weakening your position. Do you have the same enthusiasm and show the same diligence now regarding your job as when you first began working at it? There is a tendency among many people to become lax after working at a job for several months or years. Their initial interest wanes. They get into the habit of being late for work, of wasting time on the job and of making only a halfhearted effort to do their work. They seem to forget how much they need that job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By reviewing your work habits objectively from time to time, you can note what you are doing that reduces your value to your employer. Instead of being habitually late for work, make it a point to arrive a little early so you can be at your job before the starting time. You make a better impression on the management when you are working before that time rather than coming in late or just standing about, waiting for the starting hour. The same holds true at the end of the day. It is easy to get into the habit of watching the clock and stopping work a little before quitting time. The impression you make is much better when you are working when that time comes and even a little beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During working hours do you work diligently to produce as much as you can with good quality workmanship? That is what your employer is paying you to do, but if you get into the habit of wasting time during the day, of producing less than you are capable of doing and of turning out work of inferior quality, how can you expect to be among those that your employer will keep when he trims his payroll? You are not giving him full measure for the wages he is paying you. It is only right that you give him the time he pays for, as well as the best of your talent and effort. When you do you become a valuable employee that he will want to keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your self-examination should take your attitude into consideration. If it is not good, it can create a bad impression with your employer. Although you may dislike the type of work you are doing, it is unwise to manifest your dislike for it. Recognize the fact that you need the job for the wages it brings you; so try to cultivate an interest in it. Be respectful of your employer and considerate of your fellow employees. Be willing to accept instruction and correction. If you have the attitude that you know it all and cannot be told anything or that your capabilities are far superior to the position you hold, you are not likely to hold your job, much less make advancement.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark35"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark36"></a>What Employers Want</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In a survey of 129 personnel officers, it was found that the principal causes for persons being fired from their jobs were absenteeism and poor performance. Other causes were poor attitudes, failure to get along with fellow workers, theft, acting as a bookmaker for racing bets and reporting to work while intoxicated. Workers of this type are no asset to an employer. He has no substantial reason for keeping them on the payroll.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An employer’s success in business depends to a large extent upon the productivity of his employees. When he has employees that give him full measure for the wages he pays them, he is benefited, and the success he enjoys directly affects his employees. They are assured steady work with the possibility of increases in pay. It is, therefore, to your best interests to work diligently and conscientiously at your job. You are not doing this if you are frequently absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Employers realize that during the course of a year an employee might get sick and must be away from work for a few days. Usually they allow for this by permitting him to have a certain number of days for sick leave. But this provision does not mean a person should claim to be sick when he is not, just so he can use up this sick leave. Such dishonesty does not build up respect from his employers. No matter how understanding an employer may be, he is certain to lose patience with the person who repeatedly is not at work. Frequently-absent employees do not help an employer to have a successful business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is only logical that an employer, when trimming a payroll, will favor the employee who is regular and dependable rather than one who is frequently absent. It often means more to him to have a worker that he can depend on being on the job </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">than one with greater skill that cannot be </span><span class="font0">relied on. There was a case of a building contractor who had a worker that was not particularly skilled, but he could always count on that man’s being at work and working hard while there. Whenever there was a seasonal drop in construction work and some workers had to be laid off, he would keep this man on the payroll. The man that can be depended upon to be on the job and to produce, as in the case of this man, recommends himself as a desirable employee. Usually he keeps his job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The employee that performs poorly, having a low output, is actually a drag on the business. The cost for his labor is not being balanced out by his productivity. This does not help a business to compete with competitors, Low productivity raises production costs. The higher those costs go the less profit the business will make, especially in a highly competitive market. A person should realize that he has a better possibility of keeping his job by having </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">high productive output with good quality than if he fails to exert himself and has a low output</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An employer wants a worker he can depend on to do what he is told, not one that is better at thinking up excuses than doing the work. He does not want to keep a man who will glibly lie or tell half-truths to explain away his failures, his mistakes or his laziness. He can never be certain that he can trust such a person or that the man will be on hand to do a job or, if there, to do it properly. It should be evident that a person who can be trusted, who is truthful and who is dependable is more valuable to an employer than a talented person who </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">is not. These qualities strengthen Job security.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark37"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark38"></a>Conflict of Duties</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Loyalty to a company and willingness to work extra hours when necessary are appreciated by an employer. But there are limits to what an employee can give conscientiously to his job. When he is a Christian minister, he has ministerial duties to care for. In the event of a clash between these duties and secular duties, he must give first consideration to his ministerial duties, as they are his career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some companies expect employees in supervisory positions to spend many evenings attending business meetings, going to social affairs that further the interests of the company or working extra hours as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">constantly regular thing. The higher </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">position that a man holds in a company the more he is expected to center his life around his job. A Christian must center his life around his service of God and his family. He will give full measure of work for his wages, being willing to do extra work occasionally when it is necessary, but he will not permit secular duties to crowd out spiritual duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Within reason, a person can serve the interests of his employer with diligence, ability, loyalty, honesty and dependability, giving his employer solid reasons for keeping him on the payroll. By being conscious of what he can do to keep his job and by being alert to ways he can upgrade himself with knowledge in other lines of work, he can do much to avoid the unpleasant experience of being unemployed. By applying some of these suggestions, you can get a firmer hold on your job.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">C</span><span class="font0">ONSIDER for a moment how marvelously the ends of your fingers and toes are designed. Is it not remarkable that each of them is fitted with attractively shaped, serviceable nails? What a brilliant idea it was to adorn these extremities with such practical and, at the same time, handsome appendages!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fingernails make it possible to do with ease many everyday tasks often taken for granted. Without them it would be difficult to sew or to pick up small objects. But especially do the nails serve to protect from injury the sense of touch, so delicate in the fingertips.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark39"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark40"></a>Growth and Composition</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">You will observe that your nails are inserted into a fold of skin about a half inch from the tips of your fingers. The root of the nail is buried in this fold, where it is unseen to your eyes. It is here that the miraculous transformation into hard, horny cells takes place. From this production center the nail is pushed forward over the nail bed at the rate of about one-thirty-second of an inch a week, taking some four to five months to grow out from base to tip. While the nail bed does not apparently take part in the production of nail cells, it seems to contribute to their nutrition, for when the nail becomes detached</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nails are made of the same substance as hair, hoofs, feathers and turtle shells, all of which are composed of protein keratin. This complex substance is colorless and transparent when formed into healthy nails; the pink shade being caused by the blood showing through from the skin beneath.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark41"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark42"></a>What Your Nails Tell</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Due to this characteristic pink appearance of the nails, which disappears and returns promptly when pressure is applied and released, a doctor can obtain a fairly reliable index of the hemoglobin concentration. The lack of healthy red blood corpuscles in the anemic person will cause the nails to appear almost white.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this is not the only sickness of which the nails give indication. Over 2,000 years ago Hippocrates, called the “father of medicine,’’ described nails of unusual size and shape as being due to lung and heart diseases, and recent medical research has revealed that there is truth to this observation. Doctors have on occasion been guided to the correct diagnosis of a certain serious heart ailment by the appearance of the nails, and it has been found that a peculiar smooth, symmetrical bulging of the nails, sometimes referred to as “banjo nails,” may be symptomatic of lung troubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Your nails can also tell something regarding your occupation. A seamstress may find nails of sufficient length helpful in her work, whereas shorter ones may be worn by a typist or nurse. Often carpenters, gardeners and those who do physical labor can be distinguished from office workers by the condition of their nails. Some people will even notice whether your nails are in keeping with your professed occupation. If, for instance, you profess to be a minister, but your nails are dirty and unkept, they may question your claims and, perhaps, even the message you bring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is easy to tell a very tense, nervous person by the way his fingernails are chewed off. Certainly this is a bad habit that ruins one’s appearance, but breaking the habit can be a difficult problem. Perhaps wearing gloves at times of excitement will help. It may also help if you continually remind yourself that nail-biting is an ugly, offensive habit. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science Digest</span><span class="font0"> reports that a group of college nail biters cured themselves by standing before their bathroom mirrors while going through the motions of biting their nails, all the while repeating: “This is what I am supposed not to do.” Whatever method is used, selfcontrol is required.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark43"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark44"></a>Care for Your Nails</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Since your nails can advertise what type of person you are, it is wise that they be cared for. Dirty nails are not only unsightly, but they can transfer germs to an itchy spot by scratching, or even to food that may be handled. In order to keep them clean you may find it helpful to rub softened soap in, around and under the nails before you work in the garden or around the house. The dirt will later be removed with the soap when you wash with water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While they are still young, children should be trained to scrub their nails with a brush, and while drying their hands to take a few extra moments to push back their cuticles with the edge of the towel. While it may take a little effort to get into this habit, the attractive nails that will result will be worth it. Such a practice will also help to avoid those troublesome little hangnails that result when a shred of dry, hard cuticle breaks away from the side of the nail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If hangnails should occur, attend to them immediately. Do not pull them off, but clip them with a small pair of scissors and then apply a disinfectant. If scissors are not immediately available, apply a band-aid or some tape to keep the area from further injury. This will also ease the pain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some people, especially women who continually put on and take off nail polish, have trouble with brittle nails that split and break off. Soaking the fingertips in warm oil and rubbing them with nail cream nightly has been found helpful. Also a teaspoonful or two of gelatin taken daily in water has remarkably Improved brittle nails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A natural, well-groomed nail is truly a thing of beauty. It is indeed a tribute to its Master Designer who exercised such thought in adorning even the extremities of our fingers and toes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">* Did you know that certain plants are very much affected by electrical disturbances in the atmosphere? So sensitive are they that they fold their leaflets at a storm’s approach, not opening them again until the air is clear. One of such plants is the storm plant, a leguminous vine that grows in India and many tropical countries.

<p><span class="font3">T</span><span class="font0">ODAY the magnetic tape recorder is serving a multitude of varied purposes. To an ever-increasing extent it is proving invaluable in communication and transportation, in science and industry, in education and entertainment—not overlooking religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So much is this the case that a leading authority in the field of audio engineering writes: &quot;It would be difficult to state what modern-day development has had the most widespread effect, but it is certain that magnetic tape recording and the machines that use it come high on the list.” More than that, those who discuss the merits of these do not seem to be able to praise them too highly. Says one music critic, “The Millennium did indeed arrive for music lovers with the development of the magnetic tape.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ever since the year 1900 attempts at magnetic recording had been made but little progress was apparent until the 1930’s when wire recording appeared. Then around World War II the Germans developed tape recording, using it to broadcast Hitler’s speeches at all hours of the day. Hearing these broadcasts convinced United States army engineers that the Germans had something they wanted. The Germans did their best to keep this invention from falling into the hands of the Allies, and succeeded for a time, but eventually the Allies did get hold of it, together with scientific information. They at once made use of these recorders; and with the end of the war those who had to do with them, upon returning to civilian life, pushed their development still farther.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark45"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark46"></a>Advantages of Magnetic Tape Recording</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">It is not without good reason that magnetic tape recording has become so widespread, for its advantages are indeed many. One such is fidelity of sound. That is why record companies make their initial recordings on tape. Television tape has the same fidelity. It is almost impossible to distinguish it from live television.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another advantage is that tape does not require developing or processing; it can be replayed immediately. More than that, a tape recording does not wear out as does </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">phonograph record, and the same tape can be used thousands of times for recording and still be good. Even television tape, which takes quite a beating because of the high speed with which the machine's rotating recording heads pass over it, can be used some two hundred times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then, again, there is the advantage of editing. A tape can be cut, pieces taken out, or added, or replaced, as when some mistake has been made. In view of all these advantages it is no wonder that producing television shows by tape has cut the cost of production some 50 percent, certainly another decided advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Still another advantage is its compactness. One of the most popular and highly rated machines, with enormous power and high fidelity, measures but 12 by 11 by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7 </span><span class="font0">inches and weighs only twenty pounds. As for portable transistorized tape recorders —one measures but 8| by 6 J by 2J inches and weighs a mere two pounds. Tape recorders used in satellites weigh as little as eight pounds, can be held in the palm of a hand, yet are able to hold as much as three million bits of information. And recently a machine was developed for long-range plane service that uses an inch-wide tape having forty tracks, making possible forty hours of music on one reel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In flight-testing aircraft today, there are ever so many facts that, after being recorded, must be processed before they can be analyzed. Because signals on magnetic tape can be fed directly into highspeed computer machines, such as the IBM 701, for processing, flight engineers state that “magnetic tape is one of the most important tools we have” for achieving “rapid and accurate processing of flight test data.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further, since the reflexes respond more quickly to what is heard than what is seen, recorders are used to give warning signals, as in the bombers of the United States Air Force. Likewise in certain chemical plants where the hazard is particularly great, warnings are sounded by tape recorders </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">rather than depending merely on visual warnings.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark47"></a><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark48"></a>In </span><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Science, Industry and Business</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Whether man probes outer space by </span><span class="font0">means of satellites or the ocean depths to ascertain the kinds of sounds fish and other animals therein make, he employs the tape recorder. Does he go to Antarctica to see if the earthquakes that occur there from one to six times a day are caused by huge icebergs breaking off the Ross Ice Shelf? Then he also takes along his magnetic tape machine to make records, to be compared with those of the seismologists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Or does a scientist wish to study a singular language, such as that of the “Whistling Gomeros” of the Canary Islands, which language has immense carrying powers? He also uses a tape recorder. Are scientists interested in the language of birds? Then they also study them with the aid of a tape recorder, and from which study they found that bird language generally falls into two classes, either the emotional warning sound or sounds by which they convey information to one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Magnetic tape machines are also used to record the conversation between the pilots and the men in the control towers. In fact, even the conversations taking place among the men in the plane’s cockpit are recorded. And so are the instrument readings while a plane is in flight. All this information can prove invaluable in the event of an accident</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The uses of magnetic tape in the commercial world are well-nigh numberless. The factors of speed, economy, versatility, portability and fidelity no doubt largely account for this. Computing machines use magnetic tape recorders as a memory section. These machines are ideal in employee training, in audio and visual presentations and in retail business. In British Commonwealth countries tape-recorded music Is used extensively in supermarkets and launderettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Business conventions are taped and then edited and sent out to those unable to attend. By editing them an even better program is made available than was heard at the business convention, since so often speakers digress to entertain or inadvertently repeat themselves. And a tape recording of the voices of the speakers carries an impact that no printed page can do.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tape recorders are ideal for making interviews, and especially in connection with an accident, and if made right on the spot. While tape recordings generally are not admitted into, court, because of the ease with which they can be edited, yet such recordings serve well to remind the witnesses of just what they did say at the time of the accident. A tape recording did get into the New York State Supreme Court in 1962, in connection with a hearing as to the noise created by a rifle range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even farmers have found tape recorders useful; to wake up hogs in the middle of the night with sounds of grunts so as to get them to eat more and fatten quicker. Recordings are also used to chase away birds; as in Washington, D.C., where they effectively got rid of a host of starlings that were creating a nuisance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tour guides fitted out with tape recorders containing excellent descriptions are becoming increasingly popular. At one large religious edifice in western United States, tourists can at all times hear its famed choir and organ by means of a tape recording.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark49"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark50"></a>For Entertainment</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Among the many entertainment uses of tape recording are the recording of musical programs live, off radio or television or from phonograph records. In this way music lovers can arrange their own programs. Nor is drama to be overlooked. Some make a hobby of collecting various sounds, such as the bark of dogs and the song of birds. And more and more prerecorded tapes are available.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tape-recording enthusiasts like to go In for corresponding by tape. It is quite economical, saves time as well as effort and is enjoyed far more at each end than is the written letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Perhaps the most significant role that magnetic tape plays in the field of entertainment is in television. Television tape looks just like other tape except that it is two inches wide. A reel holding sixty-four minutes of program costs $250. Four tracks are recorded at one time, for sound, for picture, for editing and for regulating the speed. While the speed of the tape as it moves lengthwise is only fifteen inches per second, its several rotating recording heads move crosswise over the tape at the speed of 1,700 inches per second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not content with commercial television, engineers in leading countries are working on a home television tape-recording machine. Although possible even now, except for the price, $12,000, it is hoped that by 1965 it can be produced for $500 to $1,000.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark51"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark52"></a>In Education</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The uses of magnetic tape recording in education are limitless, and are being exploited by alert educators. Thus the Philadelphia Hahnemann Hospital used tape recorders in driving home to a gathering of a thousand physicians that the stethoscope is by no means an obsolete instrument. Leading universities use textbooks and tape recordings for home study of courses for which there is not a sufficient demand for full classes. History courses are made more interesting by the recorded voices of the very men that made history, such as William Jennings Bryan, Roosevelt and Eisenhower.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In particular is the tape recorder a valuable instrument for learning a language. A leading French school, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ecole Normale Superieure,</span><span class="font0"> has perfected a system of teaching languages by tape recorders. In such classes each student is in a soundproof booth and hears an expert speak a phrase, which he is then given the time to repeat and which is recorded. Then after filling the tape, he plays it back and so can compare how he says each phrase with the way the expert said it. He can erase his own remarks but not those of the expert. At the same time the teacher in charge of the class is in touch with each student and so can tune in on any or all students whenever he wishes. He is also able to counsel individually or collectively as he sees or, rather, hears the need for it. The machines are adjustable to the pace convenient for each student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then, again, all manner of professional men, who are interested in the quality of their voices or who play an instrument, have found the tape recorder a valuable asset. Christian ministers have found the tape recorder an aid in improving their spedking voices and their sermons or in becoming more familiar with their talks, it being one of the easiest ways of going over a Bible lecture, listening to one’s recording of it! Recorders also serve well to furnish the music for congregational singing when no other form of musical accompaniment is available.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark53"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark54"></a>Understanding Your Tape Recorder</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The first time you hear your voice on a tape recorder you may be disappointed. Why? Because you are now hearing your voice the way others hear it. You see, you have two avenues of sound for hearing your own voice. The one is by sound waves, the way you hear everything else, including others’ voices; and the other is by means of the vibrations of the bones in one’s head and which favor the lower tones. Both sets of vibrations reach the inner ear at the same time, where they blend, but also cause one to hear his own voice much more pleasing than it actually is!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As for the tape recorder itself, it may be said to consist of four basic systems: a “transport” system,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the motor that pulls the tape from reel to reel; the “heads” for recording, playing and erasing; the electronic system for the reproduction of the sound, tubes, amplifiers and speakers, and the push buttons or controls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If you choose to have a tape recorder, what kind should you buy? That depends upon your pocketbook and your taste. If you can afford to spend the equivalent of several hundred dollars and want top quality, then make sure the machine you buy has three heads and more than one motor. But for the average person one motor and two heads are adequate. Generally you pay more for better quality, although it does not necessarily follow that you will get commensurate quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As for tape-recorder accessories, there are some two hundred different ones; but perhaps the only indispensable ones are the special mending tape, lubricant and cleanser fluids. It is best to start slowly and branch out only after you are convinced of the need or desirability of doing so.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tape recorder has indeed many uses that result in both pleasure and profit. And not least among the joys of listening to a recording is the fact that you had something to do with it, in arranging, in recording and in editing the program.</span></p>
<div><img src="g_E_19640622_files/g_E_19640622-9.png" alt="" style="width:416pt;height:165pt;">
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">God, man has had to deal</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with death. Memorial stones and plaques in cemeteries throughout the world testify to the horrible consequence he has brought upon himself for turning against his Creator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Until the time comes in God’s new order of things when obedient men and women will no longer be plagued by the curse of death, the human race is compelled to cope with death's reality and must take steps to dispose of the bodies of dead persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After death the body begins to pass through a progression of chemical and bacteriological changes that would ultimately end in decomposition and putrefaction if not arrested. Thus, for hygienic as well as psychological reasons, the dead body must be removed from the presence of the living and properly disposed of. This should be done soon.—Lev. 11:32-39.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark55"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark56"></a>Preparation</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In many countries, especially those of the Western world, some attention is usually given to preparing the body for disposal. Embalming is practiced in some lands and has even been introduced in the Orient. The purpose of the embalming process is disinfection and preservation. Disinfection destroys all microorganisms and renders sterile all body tissues. Preservation is accomplished by the chemical conversion of the proteins, carbohydrates and fats of the body into a resinlike substance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to embalming, the arts of restoration and cosmetology are often used for preparing the human remains for funeral purposes. Features are rebuilt that may have been damaged or disfigured in death. Cosmetic treatment is applied to the exposed parts of the body when displayed for viewing. Not all cultures carry preparation to this extent, however.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark57"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark58"></a>Customs Vary</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">Funeral customs vary widely in different parts of the world. In some countries persons obtain a final resting-place years before it will be needed. In one Asian country an aged person often has a coffin made and stored in a clan temple long before death. He may even supervise the construction of his own tomb. Rather than becoming depressed by such premature arrangements, aged parents there take pride in the fact that provision has been made for their suitable burial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While earth burial and cremation are the usual methods of dealing with the dead in the Western world, in other countries disposal is sometimes achieved byburial beneath mounds of stones or bricks, in caves or on rock ledges. Some feed human remains to the birds by exposing them in trees or on platforms; scavenging animals may feast on others. Some burn their dead; others roast them. Elsewhere, bodies are sunk in water or are allowed to drift out to sea or down rivers. One custom calls for dividing the remains for burial, depositing the head in a box and burying the body. Or there is the dutiful method of removing the flesh from the bones and discarding or burying it, after which the bones and teeth are polished and kept. Perhaps the least imaginative custom is that of merely shutting up a body in a house and abandoning both body and house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Possibly you recognize the funeral customs of your land among these. Some of the others may be quite disturbing to you. However, remember that what seems crude or “uncivilized” to some may be the accepted practice among others far away. Religious belief, custom, law, climate, condition of the soil, availability of funeral merchandise and other factors affect the manner of disposition. To the Aslan who exposes his dead to scavenger birds and beasts, Western burial customs appear morbid. A saying that the eagle is the nomad’s coffin reflects his preference and is a reality there.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark59"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark60"></a>Mortuary Service</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In Western culture the common practice is to engage the services of a funeral establishment. In the United States alone there are more than 24,000 such places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cost of such funeral services varies. The price of a casket may be from below $100 all the way up to many hundreds of dollars. Casket selection is frequently made easier and more practical by a price card generally placed on or in the caskets displayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The average funeral service in the United States, according to a recent survey, costs about $600. This was the fee for the funeral firm’s services and the casket. Since this figure included funerals for children, the average adult funeral in the United States was costlier, nearly $750. Of course, much higher </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">costs can be involved, </span><span class="font0">depending on the section of the country and what services and equipment are requested. As to arrangements for payment, of the hundreds of funeral firms responding to the survey taken, 52 percent allowed discounts, 40 percent charged interest on an unpaid balance, and 12 percent had a finance plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to these charges, about $165 was spent, on the average, for such things as the burial plot, grave-opening and -closing, a burial vault (required by many cemeteries to prevent grave cave-ins), burial clothing (if provided by the funeral establishment), and other charges. An individual grave space without perpetual care service can often be bought for about $35. Less expensive plots can also be found. Burial space for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paupers is sometimes</span><span class="font0"> provided without charge. Opening and closing the grave cost about $35. Some religiously operated cemeteries are often more expensive, and grave space may be considerably higher. In a business-managed cemetery that provides perpetual care, a single grave space may cost from $75 to $350, while opening and closing charges can be from $45 to $150. Interment in mausoleums ranges from hundreds to many thousands of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Grave markers made of bronze cost from $75 to $300, while stone monuments start lower, at about $60, Like caskets and crypts, the cost of either can run into thousands of dollars, according to the size, material, design and craftsmanship of the marker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A cremation costs anywhere from $35 to $100, though the fee for infants and very young children may be much less. Another $25 to $100 buys an urn to hold the ashes. Buildings to house these urns, called columbaria, provide shelflike niches in which one or more urns may be placed, for a price of $25 to $750 or more, depending on the size, location and quality of the niche.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One should be careful to ascertain what the overall expenses will be. These expenses would include staff service and operational costs of the funeral establishment and also the cemetery fees. All of these costs should be clearly determined beforehand so that unexpected costs do not arise at the last moment that might create difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This shower of expenses may be disconcerting to the average person. However, extravagances can be avoided so that the funeral expense does not constitute an excessive burden on relatives. To spend money lavishly on the dead, while the living are deprived of necessities, would be contrary to Biblical principles of showing love to those alive. The grief of death is sufficient in itself without adding to it the pain of unnecessary expenditures of money that work a hardship on the living.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark61"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark62"></a>Services</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">In many lands, the next of kin have the right to determine what kind of religious service will be conducted and what religious articles will be displayed. These matters can be arranged with the one directing the funeral arrangements. Any objectionable feature not required by law or by the will of the deceased can be omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since there is a great hurt that comes with death, the Christian includes in his funeral service a discourse by a Christian minister that brings comfort to all in attendance, especially to the family suffering the loss. In this discussion the minister shows from God’s Word, the Bible, why man dies, what God’s remedy for death is, and what conditions will prevail when God does away with the curse of death. The hope of the resurrection for dead ones brings great comfort to the mourners. —John 5:27, 28.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, when such religious service paints an image of inherent immortality of the deceased in the mind of the bereaved, thus leading the living to believe that the dead are not really dead, then it does great harm. Such false doctrine highlights the great lie cultivated by the one who caused death, Satan the Devil, namely, that the humans are not dead but are alive in a spirit world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not necessary to believe a lie in order to allay suffering. Accurate knowledge of God’s new system of things, where that ‘last enemy, death, is to be brought to nothing,’ offers true consolation. Faith in this sure hope of everlasting life on a paradise earth can ease the pain of dealing with death. What a marvelous day it will be when this great enemy of man is eliminated! The God-given promise is: “And he will wipe out every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more.”—1 Cor. 15: 26; Rev. 21:4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'</span></p>

<p><span class="font17">A Final Fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•j? A snail holds tenaciously to life. Many are the accounts of land snails that went for years without food. In the 1850's a desert snail, found in Egypt and thought to be dead, was displayed on a card in a British museum. After being on display for four years, the rare specimen crawled out of its shell. It dined on cabbage leaves after resuming a more active life.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">W</span><span class="font0">HAT could it mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Preparations for a civil war? Strikes or street riots? An insurrection, which is so frequent in Latin-American countries? These could well be questions that would flash to your mind if you walked through the streets of the large seaport city of Guayaquil, Ecuador, after 6 p.m., October 11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At first sight one might think that most of the half-million inhabitants were getting set for some armed conflict. Most of the streets in the city, including the principal thoroughfares used by the public transit vehicles, are all being blocked off. Everywhere barricades are thrown up to obstruct the flow of traffic. Blocks from demolished buildings, boards, poles, packing crates, anything and everything is used to raise barriers that force automobile drivers to abandon their vehicles and go on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ah, what a relief to discover that it is only the preparation for a festival the following day! October 12 is the Day of the Race, anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus. Although it is a relatively quiet holiday in other South American countries, it is a time of boisterous merriment in Ecuador, and especially in Guayaquil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“But what race is being commemorat</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ed?” </span><span class="font0">you might ask. Few persons, if any, will give you a clear and absolute answer. Some will say it is the Latin race, others that the race' is of Spanish origin, and still others have different opinions. But, then, nobody really cares which race it is or what the significance of the celebration is, The people simply want to enjoy themselves with the festivities in the street, which they often do with disregard to the law.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark63"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark64"></a>Preparations</span></h3>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font0">The evening before and on the early morning of October 12 youngsters all over the city barricade the streets and then mark them with white lines of lime or chalk, thereby converting them into football fields. This game is called soccer in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Due perhaps to the limited playing area, sportswriters sometimes call the game indoor football, even though it is played in the streets in the open air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the streets are being converted to playing areas, they are, at the same time, being adorned with garlands of streamers. These multicolored paper streamers are stretched on wires across the streets from one building to another in such a way that the streets take on the appearance of a bedecked ship. Loudspeaker systems are installed, and the strong blasts of popular music issuing from them mixes with the excited cries of those making preparations for the festival, producing a deafening din.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Everyone is looking forward,to the morrow. The morning will feature the football games. In the afternoon the young men will have the opportunity to compete for prizes in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cucana,</span><span class="font0"> or the “greased pole.” And at night there will be dances in the streets and in other places.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark65"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark66"></a>The Day</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">When the day arrives, enthusiastic spectators cheer on their favorite football teams and players. The noise is deafening, and is often tainted with the abusive shouting of participants and spectators alike. As a rule the players do not wear uniforms, but play in their undershirts or barechested.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Following the football games comes the contest of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cucana,</span><span class="font0"> or the “greased pole.” This sport was brought to South America by the Spanish conquerors, who acquired it from old European customs. The Latin-American </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedia Dictionary Uteha</span><span class="font0"> gives the following definition for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cucana:</span><span class="font0"> “Long pole, smeared with soap or grease, which is to be climbed, if it is driven vertically in the ground.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Throughout Guayaquil such long poles of about thirteen feet in height are raised in the middle of the streets. Although they are made of the hollow trunks of the bamboo cane, they are very strong. The poles are smeared with animal fat or with soap, and at the top on two cross poles or boards are attached the prizes that may consist of any number of things: shirts, handkerchiefs, shoes, household goods and even money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the afternoon the time comes to decide who will win the prizes. Due to the heavy coating of grease or soap the first few bare-footed and bare-chested climbers do not make much headway up the pole. The friction of their bodies in their frantic endeavors to reach the top does, however, take away much of the pole’s slipperiness. Since the older and more experienced competitors realize the difficulty of scaling a superslick pole, they wait until others have cleaned the pole sufficiently to make </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">climb to the top possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While there are no written rules that govern the contest, it is the general custom that if one tires or, because of the greasiness of the pole, slides back down, the next in line then has a turn to climb for the the prizes. It is not unusual, however, to have someone climb up the pole and grab hold of the heels of one that is about to reach the prizes and pull him back down. This results in quarreling, which, on occasions, degenerates into bloody street fights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the evening, after the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cucana</span><span class="font0"> contests are over, dances are organized in the streets and elsewhere. Here alcoholic beverages are consumed in abundance and often the occasion gravitates to a promiscuous orgy.</span></p>
<h3><a name="bookmark67"></a><span class="font18" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><a name="bookmark68"></a>Examining Its Fruits</span></h3>
<p><span class="font0">The public press is divided on the propriety of the Day of the Race festivities in Guayaquil. Not a few citizens will point to the violence and juvenile crime that they sponsor. Even the press, a few years ago, lamented the shocking killing of a bus driver who made an effort to remove the barriers to get his bus through one of the play streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While a Christian finds nothing wrong with festivities that include games and dancing, it would hardly be fitting for him to take part in any celebration that glorifies a man or a race of men and that has </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">reputation for immorality and lawlessness.</span></p>

</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">HE hard-shelled Brazil nut lying on a dish of assorted nuts in a home in a modem city finds itself in surroundings that are very foreign to it. Unlike the other nuts on the dish, it did not come from an orderly grove of cultivated nut trees. It was not grown with</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font17">boundaries of civilized society but in </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font17">steaming, tropical jungles of the Amazon region in South America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Hanging high above the ground on trees that reach heights of 100 to 160 feet, the nut </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">grows in </span><span class="font17">a giant pod that holds from twelve </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font17">twenty-two nuts that are arranged inside the pod like the sections of an orange. With </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font17">hard-walled pod weighing on an average of three pounds, a person takes his life into his hands to walk under one of these trees during the season when the pods are falling. </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font17">hard pod of three pounds or more dropping from a height of 160 feet can be a deadly missile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Even </span><span class="font17">after the falling season has ended, there is a danger for a harvester, known as a </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">castanheiro,</span><span class="font17"> because of late-falling nuts. He and his fellow harvesters must work with cau</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">tion, </span><span class="font17">constantly being alert for falling nuts </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font17">for venomous jungle snakes. </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font17">pods </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font17">gathered from the ground, and in a safe spot are cracked open by means of a large knife. The nuts are then removed and depos</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">ited </span><span class="font17">in tall straw baskets. These are trans</span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">ported </span><span class="font17">to the nearest river by donkey and then shipped by boat to a processing mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">At the processing mill the nuts are sorted on racks of heavy wire mesh so that dirt and</span></p>
<div>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">spoiled nuts can be removed. The rotten nuts are sent to </span><span class="font17">a factory where they are used for making a poor grade of soap. Good nuts are shipped from the mill fresh </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">with </span><span class="font17">the shell on, dried with the shell on and dried without the shell. The greater </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">number are</span><span class="font17"> dried </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">with the shell on.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font17">The drying process is carried on in steam-heated ovens in which the maximum temperature is 50° Centigrade or 122° Fahrenheit. Anywhere from twenty-four to sixty hours are required to dry the nuts and to reduce their weight by 20 per</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">cent. They are then packed for shipment to many parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Skill is required to crack the nuts and to extract the meat in one piece. To make this easier for the women workers who do the work, the nuts to be shelled are soaked in water for at least six hours and then put into steam pressure cookers for about a minute. With the shells softened, the nuts are cracked open by the women with the help of small hand presses. Each girl learns how to operate one of these presses with skill so just enough pressure is applied to break the shell without damaging the meat inside. Her incentive for developing this skill lies in the fact that she is paid only for the unbroken meats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">There is a surprising amount of food value in these jungle nuts. Two of them are the equivalent of one egg for nourishment, while a double handful has the nutritional value of twenty eggs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Souvenirs are made from Brazil nut pods. An unbroken pod is polished after sections have been cut out of it to expose the nuts inside. Shells from pods that have been broken open make beautiful jewelry boxes, powder bowls and other curios that delight tourists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">As yet the Brazil nut trees have not been brought within the confines of cultivated farms. Their growth is too slow for commercial cultivation. Another drawback is their undependability in producing nuts. Sometimes the nuts come late and other times they are not plentiful. For the present, it seems best to depend upon the wild trees for the 8,000 tons of nuts a year that are gathered in Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">Although this jungle nut may be in foreign surroundings when it lies on a dish in a modern home thousands of miles from the Amazon, It is distinctive from all the other nuts on the dish. Only it has hung high above the floor of a South American jungle.</span></p><img src="g_E_19640622_files/g_E_19640622-12.png" alt="" style="width:204pt;height:117pt;">
<p><span class="font3">O</span><span class="font0">NE of the well-established principles of the Bible concerning marriage is that a dedicated Christian should marry only someone who is dedicated to Jehovah. (1 Cor. 7:39) Yet not infrequently some feel justified in making an exception to this principle. One argues, “it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion”; another quotes: “I desire the younger widows to marry.” (1 Cor. 7:9; 1 Tim. 5: 14) A widow with children and economically hard pressed may feel the need of getting married to solve this problem. These persons, being unable to find a mate among dedicated Christians, think that the only solution is to marry an unbeliever. They may explain, “But this person is really of goodwill; I am sure he (or she) will come into the truth.” And one may even point to cases where the unbelieving mate has come into the truth, and where both are serving Jehovah, perhaps in the full-time preaching work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But are these valid reasons for making an exception to the rule ‘marry only in the Lord’? Consider carefully what the Bible has to say and why.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principle was stated clearly by the apostle Paul when he mentioned that a woman whose husband had died was free to be married “to whom she wants, but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">only in the Lord/’</span><span class="font0"> (1 Cor. 7:39) Further, Jesus likens persons who are married as being “yoked together”; and the apostle Paul at 2 Corinthians 6:14, 15 states definitely: “Do not become unevenly yoked with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unbelievers . . </span><span class="font0">. what portion does a faithful person have with an unbeliever?” Finally, Jehovah, who instituted marriage and knows what promotes successful worship and marriage, stated in his law to the Israelites: “And you must form </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">no</span><span class="font0"> marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son.” Why? “For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against you.”—Matt. 19:6; Deut. 7:3, 4.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notice, Jehovah did not say, ‘Perhaps one will fall away.’ But “he </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font0"> turn your son from following me” and “they will </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">certainly</span><span class="font0"> serve other gods.” Why should this be so? Why is it that those who marry unbelievers usually drift away from true worship, while it is so seldom that the unbeliever is drawn toward it? Should not true worship prevail over the false ? To follow right worship requires a fight against human weaknesses. (Rom. 7:21-25) Without such a hard fight, the tendency is to drift toward the path of least resistance and freedom from responsibility, and this is what happens in most cases where a believer marries an unbeliever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Why, getting married to the unbeliever is in itself a step in the wrong direction, a weakening in the resolve to hold to true worship. In such a marriage the unbeliever did not compromise his beliefs by marrying the dedicated Christian; the believer did. Such compromise in itself could even hinder the unbeliever in accepting the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those few cases in such marriages where the unbeliever came into the truth are no evidence of God’s approval of such action, nor do they justify making an exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These persons cannot rightly say, ‘In our case it was all right,’ No, it was not right. By an off-chance the heart of the unbeliever proved receptive and a good result followed, for which we all rejoice. But God’s Word says to believers thinking of marriage, ‘Do not take that chance. Marry only in the Lord.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor does this mean a dedicated Christian could become interested in an unbeliever, and then set down as a condition for marriage that the unbeliever become one of Jehovah’s witnesses. This is the wrong motive for one to start serving Jehovah. It could give the unbeliever a bad start, and could hinder such one in getting the right view of serving Jehovah. Dedication to Jehovah should never be a mere ‘amendment’ or ‘rider’ attached to a marriage agreement. Dedication must be motivated by love for Jehovah alone, not by desire for another person.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And never forget the possibility of an unbeliever only feigning interest in God’s truth for the purpose of getting the marriage mate. What a shock to a happy young bride who, upon coming to her home after the wedding, had her husband turn sharply to her and say, “Now we are married. I am the head of the house. Do not ever speak to me of that religion again!” He had feigned interest. How much better if she had considered as a possible marriage mate only one who was dedicated to Jehovah, and shown evidence of bearing the fruits of the spirit</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But what about those who cannot find a marriage mate from among believers? The widow with children, who is hard pressed economically, sees a chance to marry a man who may belong to one of Christendom’s false religions, or who may not believe in any religion. She feels he is a good, kind, honest man. And that may be true. But the point is, does he concern himself with the worship of Jehovah?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Surely it cannot be the only solution to the problem for a dedicated Christian woman to subject herself and her children to a man who is not subject to Jehovah. By exercising faith in Jehovah and applying the good principles of the Bible, the believer will find a solution to the economic problem without violating divine commandments. Marriage to a nonbeliever will very likely create other problems with far more serious and dangerous consequences. Paul’s counsel to widows to marry does not invalidate the counsel to ‘marry only in the Lord.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The one who quotes 1 Corinthians 7:9, “it is better to marry than to be inflamed with passion,” and who argues that since he has been unable to find a dedicated mate, the only solution is marriage to an unbeliever, is thinking unsoundly. He may say it is the only alternative to being tempted with fornication and subsequent disfellowshiping. But those are not the only alternatives. There are many persons who may feel the need of getting married, but who are prevented from doing so now because of being in concentration camps or prisons; these must cope with the situation by drawing strength from Jehovah. They remember the words of the apostle Paul: “For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me.”—Phil. 4:13.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How often have faithful Christians who desired to get married experienced that, by waiting awhile because of following God’s counsel to marry only in the Lord, they have strengthened their Christian integrity, drawn closer to Jehovah and, in time, found a dedicated mate!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So the Bible rule is very clear. One should ‘marry only in the Lord.’ There exists no circumstance that suspends or revokes this principle. If your problem is marriage, seek to solve it in accord with God’s Word, and that will have his blessing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font17"> landslide of earth and rock poured down from Mount Toe, Italy, on October 9, landing in the artificial lake created by the Vaiont Dam. The effect was like dropping a large stone into a cup filled with water. A huge wall of water roared over the 875-foot-high dam. The water and mud spread destruction and death in the valleys below’. The death toll passed 2,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A New German Era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On October 15 the 87-year-old chancellor of West Germany, Konrad Adenauer, handed over the reins that he had held for fourteen years to the 66-year-old economist Ludwig Erhard. During the time Adenauer held office he guided the nation from the rubble of war to prosperity. Last year, political pressure forced him to agree to step down- Erhard was not Adenauer’s choice as a successor, but he won in a showdown vote within the party. Erhard describes himself as “an American invention,” since he was hired by the United States occupation forces as economic adviser. He is often called the architect of West Germany's incredible prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Governments Topple</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•$&gt; In eight days two governments were toppled by Latin-American military men. On September 25 Dominican President Juan Bosch was deposed and on October 3 President Ramdn Villeda Morales was overthrown. Both presidents were strongly backed by the United States. The military coups were said to halt the “obvious Communist infiltration” of governments. United States officials, of course, questioned these claims. U.S. economic aid was stopped from going into Honduras and diplomatic relations were suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Shoddy Workmanship</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On October 3 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said that upon reexamining the U.S. space capsule after its return from space, it found 720 things wrong with it. Of the flaws found, 526 were caused by poor workmanship. The agency stated that only the backup equipment and the resourcefulness of the astronauts prevented fatalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Too Much Science</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">•$&gt; Du Pont chief Crawford H. Greenewalt, in a speech, cautioned America against pressing too hard for scientific manpower. Greenewalt, himself a scientist, said that if a nation presses too hard for scientists, ‘‘scientific quality will suffer, or we will rob some other area of its creative people.” He further stated that a nation needs men in government, able men in business and in the professions. He concluded by saying: &quot;The society which creates scientists by diminishing the ranks of its philosophers may in the end have little need for either.'’</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Pact with Spain</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; In ten years Spain has received over $200,000,000 in loans and economic development from the United States in exchange for air and naval bases. Due to a recent agreement on a five-year extension of its leases, Spain will get a new loan of $100,000,000, and that in spite of the fact that Spain still does not uphold religious freedom for all its people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Modern-Language Rites Voted </span><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; On October 15 the Vatican Ecumenical Council voted </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">2,103 </span><span class="font17">to 19 to authorize the use of modem languages instead of Latin in Roman Catholic weddings, funerals, baptisms and other sacraments. It also voted to change the name of the sacrament of Extreme Unction called the &quot;last rites&quot; to “The Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick.” This was done to make clear that </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font17">sacrament is not intended merely for those who are dying. The action, of course, is only tentative. Further steps are required before these changes can take effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Nobel Peace Prize Winner</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; For the second time Dr. Linus Carl Pauling of the California Institute of Technology won a Nobel Prize. Back in 1954 he won the Nobel Prize for chemistry. And on October 10 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1962, which had been withheld last year. The 1963 prize was awarded to the International Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies. Informed sources say the prize was awarded the scientist for his work toward establishing a nuclear test ban. </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">Dr. </span><span class="font17">Pauling stated: &quot;For many </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">years </span><span class="font17">it has not been respectable to work for peace. Perhaps the Norwegian Nobel Prize committee’s action will help to make it respectable.” He felt the prize would encourage workers for peace all over the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">1963 Disaster Toll</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font17"> for October 13 stated that over 30,000 persons had lost their lives in natural disasters so far in 1963, The disaster toll was caused by landslides, earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones and a volcanic eruption. Hurricane Flora was one of the worst experienced in the Atlantic area, Haiti and Cuba suffered great losses in property and lives. The director of the Haitian Red Cross said: “You just don’t see any people” where once there were towns. The estimate of lives lost there due to the storm was over 4,000. An additional 1,000 were said to have perished in Cuba as a result of the hurricane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Wheat Sales</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Canada, on September 16, made the biggest one-year sale of wheat in history to the Soviet Union. By July 31, 1964, Canada will ship to Russia 227,500,000 bushels of wheat. The wheat will cost Russia 5,500,000,000, of which 25 percent </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">will be</span><span class="font17"> paid In cash and the balance within 18 months. Cuba will get $33,000,000 worth of the wheat. In the United States reaction to the transaction was mixed. Senator Kenneth B. Keating of New York called the sale “a shocking breach&quot; of efforts to isolate the Castro regime in Cuba. Senator William Proxinire said the transaction was “not good for the free world or the United Sates.&quot; Less than a month later, on October 9, U.S. President Kennedy approved the sale of $250,000,000 worth of U.S. wheat to Russia. Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary, Soviet-bloc countries, have also asked for wheat. Their request covers about $60,000,000, which would make the total sale $310,000,000. Kennedy defended his decision to permit the sales, adding that if the United States did not sell wheat to the Soviet Union, cold war activity might be renewed. Most businessmen approved of the arrangement. However, former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon called the decision a major foreign policy mistake, &quot;even more serious than fouling up the Bay of Pigs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">World Population Soars</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit educational organization in Washington, D.C., said in its 1962 annual report that world population increased 60,000,000 in 12 months. It stated further that by the end of the 1960's world population will really be soaring and that the fate of the world will hang between production and reproduction. Records show that for every one person who dies two are being born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">A Return to Poverty?</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;■$&gt; ‘Drop your glowing titles and lay down your gold and silver pectoral crosses in exchange for crosses of bronze or wood,' was the proposal made by the Roman Catholic </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Archbishop Helder</span><span class="font17"> Pessoa Camara of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on the eve of the second session of the Vatican Council. The New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Times,</span><span class="font17"> September 23, said that in a long paper the archbishop emphasized that to facilitate union with “our separated brethren,&quot; a return to poverty is “more important than </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">the examination of</span><span class="font17"> points of doctrine.” He suggested the suppressing of titles such as &quot;excellency” and “eminence” and that the Catholic bishops give up their expensive crosses, rings and high-powered limousines. It is not expected that the recommendation will be warmly </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Birth Defects</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">'*&gt; A group of doctors </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">In the </span><span class="font17">United States stated that if women take B vitamin supplements during pregnancies fewer birth defects, such as a cleft lip or palate, will result. Reporting the results of a test, </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World News</span><span class="font17"> said: “Of the </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">576 women in the </span><span class="font17">study, 158 took a B vitamin supplement during the first trimester. In this group 3.8% gave birth to children with deformities, including 2.5% with cleft lip or palate. But in the 418 untreated women, the incidence of congenital </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">defects was 7.9%, of which 4.7% had cleft lip or palate.&quot; Vitamin B deficiencies among pregnant women, say doctors, result from an unbalanced diet, over-cooking, cooking in vinegar or baking soda, among other things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Teen-Age Spending</span></p>
<p><span class="font17"># There are more than 11,000,000 teen-agers today in the United States and, according to the New York Post, September 26, “they spend $6,000,000,000 a year.” The paper goes on to say; “Teenage boys and girls have allowances and earnings of almost $11,000,000,000, spend these to the hilt. By 1965 there will be 23,000,000 boys and girls 13 to </span><span class="font17" style="font-weight:bold;">19, </span><span class="font17">a growth of 30 per cent since 1960 against an 8 per cent growth in our total population and an actual 1 per cent drop in the 25-39 group. Within two years population projections indicate half the people in our country will be under 25 years of age. By 1970 the teenage </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">population will be 27,-</span><span class="font17">000,000 and they’ll be spending at least $18,000,000,000 a year.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">“The Greatest Guilt”</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">&lt;$&gt; Outside the City Theater in Basel, Switzerland, some 3,000 demonstrators paraded in Silent protest against the play called' “The Representative” by West Germany’s Rolf Hoch-huth. It is a dramatic indictment of Pope Pius XII for his failure to intercede during Nazi persecution of Jews and Christians. A riot broke out between 1,000 demonstrators and the police. In London persons under 16 were prohibited from attending. In advance of the London opening, Nobel Peace Prize-winner Albert Schweitzer is quoted by the New York </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Post,</span><span class="font17"> September 25, as saying: “We are all guilty today for the reason that we were all guilty then. . , . The Catholic Chureh bears the greatest guilt, because as a great international organization she could have taken some action.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Cars on U.S. Roads</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">The Bureau of Public Roads announced on September 21 that the number of motor vehicles registered in the United States totaled 82,058,000. The passenger-car total is 68,452,000; trucks and buses, 13,606,000. California leads in registrations, with more than 9,000,000,</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Epilepsy and Narcolepsy</span></p>
<p><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Q&gt;</span><span class="font17"> Attacks of epilepsy and narcolepsy may be headed off by the use of will power, said Dr. Arthur W. Epstein of Tulane University. </span><span class="font17" style="font-style:italic;">Medical World </span><span class="font17">Netos, August 16, 1963, carried this report: “A 19-year-old male patient with temporal lobe seizures experienced the beginning of an epileptic attack while driving his car at high speed. He was able to ward off the attack, he told Dr. Epstein, by ‘thinking </span><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">1 </span><span class="font17">would make it. I prayed to God to keep going. I said, “I won’t stop. I won’t pass out.” ’ He kept conscious until he arrived home, where the epileptic attack occurred. Another patient, a 38-year-old narcoleptic can fight off cataleptic and epileptic episodes by telling himself he is ‘coming through.’ , . . One middle-aged epileptic wards off seizures by 'clenching my fists and gritting my teeth.’ And a female patient.. , can stop the seizure by visualizing a formed object, such as the image of a dog or fish.” Further studies of the attention process may prove valuable, the report stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font16" style="font-weight:bold;">Against Smoking</span></p>
<p><span class="font17">On September 7, according to a published Reuters report, the director general of the Netherlands Public Health Service, Dr. Piet Muntendam, said that the number of deaths from cancer in the Netherlands increased from 18,388 in 1961 to 20,333 in 1963. The Dutch government has budgeted about $56,000 or 200,000 guilders to wage a publicity campaign against smoking.</span></p><a name="caption2"></a>
